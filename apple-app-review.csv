"The app has been working great! As for the purpose of the app, I can‚Äôt think of a better (and easier) way to help others in my spare time than to guide them when needed. Calls cover every aspect of daily struggles some vision impaired people face; which one is the shampoo or conditioner? Is this a red shirt? Or how about: Which tube is toothpaste and which one ointment (both smell minty!) My wife also supports my participation by doing things to help me have a good interaction - such as turning the sound off the TV if we happen to be watching when a call comes in... we high-five when a call goes well and I‚Äôve helped some one out. Please download the app and give it a try. You don‚Äôt have to answer every call - but when you do, the rewarding experience of helping a stranger by simply describing what you see (for them) is golden. And if you need help ... get the app and call me... I‚Äôll be here waiting to help! PS I think it‚Äôs important to note this is a ‚Äúhelper‚Äù app and not a venue for social connections. I keep my interactions very professional as to not impose myself when all the caller wants is a quick hand without feeling like they have to spend more time than necessary on the app. It‚Äôs a tool for them so respect that. Of course sometimes conversations happen - that‚Äôs OK, but let it be on the recipients terms, not yours."
"I am a volunteer I signed up 2 days ago and got my first call earlier today!!! I was playing with my phone when all of a sudden this weird ringtone came on I looked down and was shocked and super excited at the same time! After talking to some friends that have it and reading the reviews I didn‚Äôt expect to get a call for a while so I was super shocked I was getting my first call already üòä. It was as amazing as I expected, didn‚Äôt take much time at all I helped a gentleman with his computer and logging on (letting him know what was on his laptop screen and when it turned on) easy peasy.. I was so grateful to be able to be there for him and thankful for an app like this one! Seriously this app is amazing and have told everyone I know about it! My soon to be 18 he old daughter now has it on her phone as well üòä There is no better feeling you get when you know that you‚Äôre helping people. For me it really put the little things into perspective... Just how much I take them granted.. ok ok  I could go on I love it so much lol so I‚Äôll end with this absolutely love this app, works like a charm so far, you guys are amazing for making this and I‚Äôm truly grateful to be part of it!"
"I love answering calls because it humbles me that low vision or blind people go through a lot of extra work just to get through daily life. And to be able to make it easier for them means the world to me. It ALWAYS makes me smile even if I‚Äôm having a bad day by helping. Everyone is so grateful and wonderful to work with. I even helped out a man with narrowed vision who voluntarily goes out and helps homeless people and needed help reading a SUPER small print sheet that had all the resources for people in need. He just needed to find the one for housing to help people get back on their feet. Not only are they giving back and volunteering, but I felt a part of it at the same time because I was able to help him find the resources he needed so he could give out to those he helps who are homeless. Someone with a disability giving back in the way they receive help themselves is the definition of giving forward. And I just think this is Suh an amazing app, with amazing people all over the world. I can‚Äôt want until my next call to help out someone new. Now if I could also meet them, that would just mean the world to me to meet these incredible people. They inspire me."
"This App really makes it easy to be the eyes for someone with low vision or even blindness.  You answer a special ring tone if you have time (usually about 10 mins or so) if not someone else probably can get it.  I always try to make time when I can.  The callers need help with rather simple tasks and they know what they need but not being able to see is their only obstacle.  With CoVid 19 isolating low sighted and blind persons from their normal support group of sighted friends and family has left them in a lurch.  Once it was helping a lady find the right bills to pay for grocery delivery,  once helping a lady read her prescription number to a pharmacist over the phone, helping someone who needed to match an outfit for a job interview (not used to wearing business clothes) and helping with computer issues.  Nothing has been too hard or too time consuming and the feeling of being able to help someone pick the right train track can be a godsend to the person on the other end.  Reminds me not to take my sight for granted. The callers are very respectful of your time and truly appreciate the help."
"I love having this app on my phone. While I have only received two calls in the last 6 months (I was too late to answer my first call, but successfully answered the second call today!), it‚Äôs still amazing that I was able to help someone with something so small; something the rest of us take for granted every day. 

Today a woman called asking if I could help her adjust her thermostat. When she pointed the camera, it was a little low. I asked her to hold the phone up a little, and then I was able to see the thermostat clearly. Her heat was set on 70¬∞, so she counted the buttons up to 75¬∞ and I let her know she had successfully turned her heat up. She said she didn‚Äôt need anymore help and thanked me for helping! I told her she was welcome and to have a great day. She was very sweet and I was glad I got to help:) 

A lot of these reviews seem to forget this app is for the visually impaired. It isn‚Äôt about how many calls you get to answer, or how great you feel because you volunteered. This app is designed to help those who need it. I think it‚Äôs wonderful that so many people volunteer, regardless of the number of people that need help."
I think many people enjoy helping so it‚Äôs a good way to help.  I‚Äôve had maybe 5 calls in 2 years but only able to answer one of them fast enough and it was a person paying for a taxi verifying the correct payment amount.  You probably will only get a few calls and maybe be lucky enough to answer one or two because there‚Äôs WAY more volunteers than users but it seems like a great service for those with visual impairments.  If you have an iPhone you need to make sure it doesn‚Äôt offload the app to the cloud because you may only get a call like every few months so if you don‚Äôt use it iPhone will offload it to the cloud and you won‚Äôt get notifications when you have a call.  This is probably a comment for another forum but in general ‚ÄúApple‚Äù needs to make an iOS fix to allow the user to designate certain apps (any app) to not ever go to the cloud due to inactivity.  Seems like this is kind of an obvious missing feature from the iPhone settings ‚ÄúApple‚Äù‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt you go ahead and fix that for all of us mmmkay?
"I downloaded this app about 2 years ago. I did it the first second I learned of it. I jumped at the chance to answer a call every time I saw my phone ringing, but I was never quite quick enough! Which goes to show you how many great Americans are out there who want to help just as much as I do! Finally though it happened... My phone rang and I clicked to answer and I actually started to be connected with the caller! She wanted something as simple as me telling her which bag of candy was which because she had about 5 bags of miniature candy. That was it. The overwhelming joy that my heart felt to be able to help someone who‚Äôs incapable of doing such small tasks such as that, overjoys  me. After the call I just was stuck sitting there for a moment with a smile on my face, and almost sad that I couldn‚Äôt help her with more. I hope others can join this app too and have the chance to answer a call to feel the happiness I felt. God bless whomever came up with this app and I hope to be able to continue to help those who cannot help themselves."
"I recently read about someone who had troubles getting help because nobody answered. Well, I always try to answer, but I have to unlock my phone first. By the time I get it unlocked, the call has been passed to someone else. If I have more than a few seconds to answer, I would be able to answer more often. It would be great if the request came through as a FaceTime call; I think I don‚Äôt have to unlock my phone for that. Furthermore, I would be more useful if I could set my app to available or unavailable when I‚Äôm sitting idle or driving. Because of the issues I have answering and the rarity of requests, I have often considered deleting the app altogether. 
 Other than my two complaints, I have enjoyed the app. I really enjoyed helping the two folks I was able to assist. I‚Äôll be honest, I get really excited when the opportunity to help someone arises. Helping others is what I enjoy most in life, but I would like more opportunities to do so. Thank you to the creators of Be My Eyes for creating something so wonderful. I don‚Äôt expect it to be perfect, but I hope my feedback helps improve the experience for everyone."
"I love being able to help someone day or night 24/7. There is many people who are willing to answer the call whenever you need help. I just have one wish that the assistant could have settings where we can make our calls louder and call whenever we want not just where we live, instead of the original of what comes with the app. I am half deaf so I can barely hear when someone calls, but I have my volume up the highest it can go, and I have my settings on the loudest it can do on my part on my phone. I wish the app would fix or put in settings where you can choose a louder sound for calls. I would love to help more people if the app can put better features that can happen so I can get to my phone faster. Lol I just love helping people!  But other than that I am very happy to be able to help the visually impaired and I hope more visually impaired people will use this app for help there are so many volunteers there is always someone there 24/7 to help you in any country!"
"I just had my first call with an absolutely lovely young lady who needed help with her thermostat and reading the instructions on a food item she wanted to heat. I was honestly just so happy to have finally received a call and I hope that I was thorough in helping her. She was so sweet and fun to talk to as well, which is just an added bonus!

I wish I had remembered the ‚Äòscreen shot‚Äô feature sooner in the call (ahh!) because it is a total game changer. Hopefully I have a second call now that I‚Äôm familiar with the platform.

So, New volunteers, here are a few tips if you‚Äôre feeling unsure:
-  dont forget the ‚Äòscreenshot‚Äô, ‚Äòtorch‚Äô and being able to background the app (useful to look something up via the browser on your phone during the call if needed) 
- Make sure that after you both complete the task(s) at hand, you ask again if they need help with anything else (possibly a continuation of what the call was about i.e. I wish I would have asked if she needed help with actually preparing the food item after I read her the heating instructions for it, without overstepping).    

The interface of Be My Eyes is next level, top notch, A grade‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs an understatement.

In closing, this short interaction did just as much for me (if not more) than it did for her. Thank you for giving me the chance to make someone‚Äôs life a little easier (I hope! üòÑ). 

Best App, ever. <3"
"I have been a member about 6 months. I was the first to answer a call for the first time about a month ago. That gentleman was new to the app and just wanted to try it out and ask some questions. Today I received a call where a woman had three pairs of tights, and needed to know which were blue, brown, and black. It was easy to help her and she seemed very grateful. 

As someone with RP but who still has very functional vision, it is so rewarding to be able to offer assistance. I have seen negative reviews from others that were frustrated they rarely got calls, and were never the first to answer. It was five months before I was actually able to help someone, so just stick with it. I think it is also helpful to remember this isn't about you, it's about the person that needs assistance. Basically you have nothing to lose by being a member, and eventually will be able to assist someone. I am glad there are services like this out there for me when I need help someday."
"I‚Äôve been involved with this project for a year or so now and I‚Äôm still just as happy with the app as when I started. Since the purpose of the app is to connect someone with a question to someone who can give a visual response, I have no suggestions on how to improve it. It does exactly that. 

I think it might be helpful to be told how to respond answering the call though. The callers are always nice, but not looking for friends or conversations. Just answers to their momentary dilemma. I answer: ‚ÄúHi, this is Helen. How can I assist you today?‚Äù  It‚Äôs short, friendly and informative. The caller doesn‚Äôt always give their name and usually go straight to their question. 

My calls so far are: do these slacks match this blouse? I have 2 pieces of mail; who are they from? How much is this bill for? I‚Äôm in a meeting and don‚Äôt know what the error message is on my screen. And the like. 

I have missed a few calls because I didn‚Äôt answer the phone quickly enough and my disappointment was always real. I‚Äôm glad the service moves quickly through phone contacts to better help the caller, but disappointed that the helper wasn‚Äôt me. If I did nothing else that day, I knew I gave someone real help and the sense of pride and satisfaction is terrific! 

Long review, but aside from wishing I received more calls, I can‚Äôt recommend this app or service enough! It‚Äôs 5 star across the board!"
"I love having this app on my phone and think it‚Äôs a great way to help! I am always willing to help whoever calls with whatever it is they need as my sight is something I often forget about being a blessing to have and to think how scary it must be to not have sight makes me want to ease that fear, even if just a little! The apps like these!, the ones that truly make things better for others, are not often found and it would be such a better place if we were able to ha e more apps like theses as it can serve as a reminder to be grateful for what we do have and to remember that when we think it‚Äôs the worse it actually is worse for others and it can put a little nudge in your ear that says, ‚Äúseriously?‚Äù Here I am complaining about this when there‚Äôs people that will never know what the sky looks like, or the color of rain! It‚Äôs very humbling and rewarding all at the same time! Thanks for this reminder and opportunity!"
"I can‚Äôt believe how many self entitled reviewers are giving this app a negative review because they ‚Äúweren‚Äôt given enough time to answer‚Äù or never get to answer calls as if this is some game they‚Äôre not being picked to play in. If Someone else gets there faster than you, then that means someone who needed help got it quicker and that‚Äôs never a bad thing and it means the app is working as intended‚Ä¶ with as little wait time as possible for the blind/visually impaired. This app works for those who need it and not for those who want to pat themselves on the back. I‚Äôve had 3 interactions in 3 years and many calls where I wasn‚Äôt the one to be connected. If you really want to be available to help then it‚Äôs worth it to keep the app on your phone for that one time where maybe not many people are in a position to answer the call, but you are."
"I have had the opportunity to answer a call twice. The first time I was helping a gentleman with a clock. I caught myself saying ‚Äú.do you see this button‚Äù and of course quickly realize how dumb I sounded and needed to find other ways to describe like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a button on the left of it, try to feel for it‚Ä¶‚Äù. He was very appreciative and didn‚Äôt seem frustrated by my ‚Äúdo you see‚Äù comments. The second time was a woman going out for the evening and had some top laid out on the bed to match her pants.   This time I was sure to be careful with my choice of words. We had a lovely chat and I helped her pick her outfit.  Both times only took maybe 10 minutes and I‚Äôm sure I got more out of it then the folks I helped did. Both times when I hung up, I gave thanks for the health of my eyes, something most of us take for granted daily. Way to go Be My Eyes!

"I am a sighted person who receives calls from blind people seeking help, and I cannot express how it fills my heart to know that even on days that I stay in my pajamas, I can be of service to another person. Even something as small (to me) as indicating the color of socks laid out in front of my screen, clearly makes an impact on the person calling. I‚Äôve talked to lovely people and encourage more people who are no and multilingual to join. There are many times over the volunteers versus the blind, but I imagine not a huge amount with that skillset. I‚Äôd highly recommend this app, either way. It truly does make a difference for both parties and I am grateful to have been able to partake in it. Such an intelligent and awesome way to solve a problem that lifts the burden off someone who may otherwise have to seek out family or friends who aren‚Äôt right there with them."
"Update after three years continuous use as a sighted helper:  the app has come a long way in development (wasn‚Äôt horrible at the beginning though) and is now very solid and refined.  Excellent software and network.

With 0.8 million sighted folks on the net at this writing expect anytime/all the time assistance if you are blind / VI, and an incoming call every few months if you are sighted.

Give it a try without hesitation.

‚Äî‚Äî-(original review)‚Äî‚Äî-

Been a sighted helper on the net for a couple years.  Current version has decent connection stability, very easy to take a call and render assistance when needed.  If I‚Äôm unavailable (driving, busy, etc.) the notification is distinct but NOT invasive, and it clears quickly without intervention.  Nearby folks will notice it but it‚Äôs unlikely you get harsh reactions if a call comes in at a bad time.

Due to the huge sighted : blind ratio of users on the net, incoming assist calls will be very infrequent.  If you get 10 a year, consider yourself lucky unless you sign up as fluent in multiple languages.

As a sighted helper, It‚Äôs EASY to do, FUN to help folks, and takes virtually ZERO time and effort.  As a blind user, know that there‚Äôs an army of ‚Äúlight dependent‚Äù folks eager and excited to lend a hand anytime and as often as you like.

This a great network.  One of the best applications of smartphone tech I‚Äôve encountered.  Grab a copy and join in."
"I saw the ad on somewhere. I looked on App Store and said I need to get this right now. First call I helped the woman choose clothes. It really puts a huge smile on my face for a easy and caring thing that a lot of humans can do. I got a few more calls. I love it!! You get to help people no trouble. I myself is disabled. I have a prosthetic leg. If it was switched I would really be thanking the creators and volunteers for simple kindness. I‚Äôm disabled, but not enough to not help someone else disabled or not disabled. This is one of my favourite apps. Also you can be rated. Don‚Äôt worry getting bad volunteers because than they could not get calls when you rate badly. One thing that is a less joy and more of a curse is the numbers of volunteers. The number grow everyday and so I get less calls. But every call. I smile so big. Thank you creators. This is one of my favourite apps."
"Isn‚Äôt it amazing to be able to see what color socks you will put on in the morning? They are some people that don‚Äôt have that luxury, we as a human race know how to share with one another. The ability to help one another is embedded in all of us. The kindest gesture to help a person in need, is to be able to give them your time. Just a few moments to ease the persons mind in this time of struggle. I don‚Äôt have the resources to be able to fund $1 million project but I have the ability to help a person choose a color shirt, the correct socks for the day or night, and maybe your thermostat isn‚Äôt working and you can‚Äôt remember whether it‚Äôs on hot or cold. There is many of us that will be awaiting a call no matter the time no matter the situation. It all starts with one little change, being compassionate to one another can go along way."
"I work in a doctor‚Äôs office and learned about BME through a patient telling me she sometimes has to use the app to tell which prescription is which when her usual pharmacy that offers braille labels isn‚Äôt available to fill a script. Everyone on our staff immediately downloaded the app, and anytime we get a notification to accept!  I‚Äôve only gotten to help just a single person so far, but as a volunteer, this app really gives us a sense of what it means to be human, to give back to humanity, unselfishly. If more of us gave so freely of just a few minutes of our time each month, collectively, think of what else we could accomplish!
Don‚Äôt download the app to make yourself feel better. That‚Äôs a selfish reason. But if that just happens to be a consequence of wanting to help others, then that‚Äôs what humanity is about!"
"Earlier today I got my first call.  I am so glad this app is there to help people who may not always have someone around, I hope this app gets spread to more people who need it and I‚Äôm so glad that the people on it are so nice, I was a little sceptical about the idea of this at first but then as I use it and as I help people with the little things I understand why they would make this, the man I helped today was absolutely so sweet and kind and he was just asking me to help him figure out what some of his groceries were and it was an honor, I helped him sort his coffee and mashed potatoes, and you should‚Äôve heard his voice when I told him he had picked up his cottage cheese, he was so happy and I realize it‚Äôs the little things in life we take for granted, download this app, you won‚Äôt regret it."
"This app is truly an awesome way to help others who have visual impairments. Whether it‚Äôs helping someone pick out clothes for the day or read the mail, this app is all about helping others. It‚Äôs truly amazing that the developers care so much about this app and the group that are being supported by it. I‚Äôve never seen an app show so much support for its volunteers. I would highly recommend downloading this app. And it might take days, weeks and even months before you are able to answer the call. But when you do, you really are helping someone. I just got my first call today after being on the app for more than 3 months, but even when I wasn‚Äôt answering phone calls, I still got updates from the app including articles and other people‚Äôs stories."
"I used this app for the first time ywsterdya and was sooooooo excited. Being colorblind means I need a lot of help with what is typically simple every day stuff. Matching clothes, putting together a flyer and matching font colors to graphics, things that people who see color have no issues with. The lady I spoke with was as sooooo sweet and helped me pick a. Font color that would be easily visible to those who can and can‚Äôt see color and one that matched the colors on my flyer I was making. It felt SO GOOD to be able to do something color based while I was home alone. It meant not having to stop what I‚Äôm doing and wait for a family member to come home or try to catch one of them on FaceTime. I can‚Äôt tell you how giddy it made me to just complete a task like that and go about my day. Thank you!!!!"
I really love this app in the way that it helps people. I‚Äôve had this for about two years now and have been able to answer about four calls. I help someone make a homemade pizza and also help someone get things at the grocery store! I get the calls every so often but normally someone always picks up before I can which is great that someone can be helped! Unfortunately my last call was an extremely rude person and a VERY inappropriate. Not sure how this app could filter that sort of thing because it‚Äôs not like you can ask someone prove that blind or not! üò¨ i‚Äôve seen lots of negative posts about this sort of thing and I am going to keep the app just in case I can help someone who is actually needing it and will just hang up on the inappropriate rude people.
"I‚Äôve had this app for about a month and half now and I‚Äôve never wrote a review for anything, but I absolutely love the idea of anyone in the world who‚Äôs visually impaired can receive instant assistance at the snap of their fingers. As stated title I‚Äôve never gotten a notification and that‚Äôs not a problem at all but while downloading the app, I was so excited to actually make a difference and help someone. I absolutely love the fact that over 2 million people have volunteered on this app but I feel there is a large number of visually impaired individuals who do not know about the app. I strongly feel the creators of the app need to advertise on a larger scale or start branching out so the app can be more accessible to everyone who needs it."
"I just took a Be My Eyes call and spent a hour talking to a 27 year old man from Pakistan who‚Äôs going blind. He wasn‚Äôt born blind, he‚Äôs losing it slowly and he needed someone to talk to as he didn‚Äôt get the job he applied for today due to his condition. He‚Äôs here on a student visa in NC and was hitting rock bottom tonight, alone with no family around. What are the odds that me, sitting here with a broken arm feeling sorry for myself would get that call? I‚Äôll heal in 6-12 weeks and he‚Äôll never see again. I talked to him about all the wonderful things he has yet to smell, touch, hear, taste and feel, that he has a good life ahead of him. That he‚Äôs not alone, I met a new friend named Shehryar. I needed this tonight 
Then we connected on LinkedIn so I can help build his resume:)
#BeMyEyes"
"My only complaint is there aren‚Äôt more calls to take.  I grew up with a completely blind grandmother and my sister now suffers from being legally blind.  I grew up helping my grandmother the way the visually impaired need help through this app.  I wish this was around when my grandmother was alive.  It makes me feel good to know I can be the eyes for those who live in darkness or cannot see well enough to do even simply tasks.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with emotion when I help someone through this app.  This makes me sad but also so happy that I can help others, and so easily.  I don‚Äôt even need to leave my home.  I hope the creators are able to get the word out to more visually impaired people so I can get more calls."
"I downloaded the app and signed up about a month ago, and was told it may take a while for me to get my first call. I had honestly almost forgotten about the app when I got a notification that someone needed assistance, and my heart started racing! Lol I was able to assist someone who needed help figuring out which settings their washing machine was on, and they were so sweet during the call. We chatted for a moment after I‚Äôd helped them and said our goodbyes, and the smile hasn‚Äôt left my face since. This really made my night, and I‚Äôm so happy I was able to help someone! I definitely recommend this service from a helper‚Äôs perspective. I hope it‚Äôs just as wonderful for those seeing help, too!"
"I noticed the app in the App Store and decided to download. This was nearly two weeks ago as I guess I was a little skeptical to use it. This past Sunday as I was getting ready to go to lunch, I pulled out a chain that I wanted to put a gold pendant on.  Now...is the chain silver or gold?  I asked myself as if I knew. So, I figured this may be a good time to try Be My Eyes...After creating my account I was connected with a very kind young lady who was able to tell me the chain was gold!  What a huge help to this blind lady who loves her jewelry and clothes! Thank you Be My Eyes and thank you to the awesome volunteers who truly can make a difference in peoples lives.  The only downside is I really wish Be My Eyes had been around before I lost my sight because I would have loved to have been a volunteer!!"
"I recommend everyone download this app. I‚Äôve had some normal calls where I just helped people shop or change the thermostat. But the call I just received was just awesome. It was an elderly man from Dunedin, New Zealand. He needed help identifying bottles of liquor and I told him I was already in the process of drinking some whiskey. We ended up taking shots together and talking about life. Seriously this app is awesome. Will never forget this experience. Added note. When you do get a call, try to make it fun and memorable for them. They‚Äôre blind/impaired. Do anything you can to improve their quality life. You will see first hand how far some jokes and a positive attitude can go"
"What a wonderful opportunity this app has given me. As a sighted volunteer, I feel so fortunate to have the chance to help someone. We have more than enough bad things going on this planet, BME has put together people who need each other. The visually impaired have always been at the forefront of people who I respect. It takes a person of strong fortitude and nerves of steel to be able to survive in this age of callousness. 

When I took my first call I wanted to make sure that I did it correctly. The gentleman that I assisted was so kind. My heart sank when the call ended because I felt that I did not do enough. Even the shortest call can make such a big impact on the lives of all involved. I will definitely be in for the long hall. This app should be #1 in the App Store."
"I haven‚Äôt gotten to answer a call yet. I just signed up. But flipping through the app, I‚Äôve watched a few stories. I‚Äôve seen the stats. We have over 1 million volunteers and only 80,000 who might need help on occasion. I‚Äôm not going to be disappointed if I don‚Äôt get a call right away or even if I don‚Äôt get a call for a month! 
For those who wish there was a toggle, your account only gets called when your logged in (I read some info from the developer). If your going to bed, or going to be away/unavailable, log out. Log back in when your available or awake. 
Lastly, perverts are everywhere. I‚Äôve gotten sexual messages and pictures (really gross) on Facebook messenger before. Just got to hang up and move on. 
I cannot wait to help my first person! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This app is a phenomenal idea and I love how it works! Within the first few weeks of becoming a volunteer I was able to answer two separate calls; both visually impaired people were so kind and appreciative for the help, and I felt great being able to assist them with small tasks in which I take my own vision for granted. With millions of volunteers and only a few hundred thousand members who are visually impaired, calls are far and few between. I personally even know many people who are not blind but are visually impaired in some way and would benefit from an app like this if they got over that sense of ‚Äúpride‚Äù and just asked for help. I hope this app continues to gain popularity and help those that need it!"
I am a volunteer the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the volunteer to impaired ratio is drastically skewed. There are WAY more visually impaired people who need help this app needs to market to them and advertise more so more visually impaired people sign up. This app sound also alert the impaired that there are 4million volunteers and to please call any second of their day they need help. There are so many of us eager to help I don‚Äôt feel like the app does a good enough job in marketing to really impact the visually impaired with out knowledge or whom feel like they are over using the app bc they are not sooo many of us get a call 1-2 time a year they could be calling way more or have way more people signing up to use the app (visually impaired) if they had a more aggressive marketing strategy.
"this app is wonderful!  thank you for making it!  it is such a blessing for everyone.  

does anyone know if the same type of app exists for hearing?  so far the apps i have found are for automatic transcriptions, but if people could actually ""hear"" for others, nuances can be identified, such as ""what is this vibration?""  ""is this machine making the correct sound?""  ""is anything beeping in my house?""  ""are there any warning sounds right now?""  ""is my dog barking outside?"" ""are the birds singing?""  Be My Eyes already has a strong dedicated community, wouldn't it be amazing if hearing impaired people can also be helped just like this?  

thank you again for this amazing app!  much Love and Blessings!!! üôèüåàüíñüëÄüëÇ"
"i wanna prefix this review by saying this is a great idea for an app, but it‚Äôs cursed with poor execution. the first complaint about this app is that nobody has ever called me. it‚Äôs been around 1 1/2 years since i‚Äôve gotten this app, just crickets. it would warm up my week if i got at least one call from someone, but this app doesn‚Äôt ever give me any calls. the other complain is that my grandpa has been using this app, but when he calls people to help him a lot of the times, people give him the wrong information. we‚Äôve had a lot of hecklers call him to tell him things that aren‚Äôt true, and make his life even harder. i don‚Äôt get the point of letting anyone volunteer. this reminds me of the situation with betterhelp, it allows anyone to be a volunteer and supposedly ‚Äúhelp others.‚Äù this is a great idea for an app, but it is too flawed."
"This is an amazing app and I love being able to help people. I just got out of the hospital being in over a week and a half long, going through about 12 surgeries and dying once already in 2020(this all began in January). I am almost certainly guaranteed to no longer be able to work. It would be nice to be able to get more calls that way I can talk to more people and possibly even gain my friends.
I do understand that there are a lot more people signed up to help them or are that need help. But I feel like the algorithm should be skewed more towards the people that always answer their calls adequately. We also have no way of seeing our ‚Äúreview‚Äú from the person being assisted. If this isn‚Äôt already feature it would definitely be nice to see."
"I got my first call last week. It was a video chat with a man who got a new watch and needed to set it to speak instead of being read only. It took about twenty minutes because I had to Google the manual and walk him through it. When we finally got it working, he was so happy and excited. It felt so nice hearing the excitement in his voice. It's easy to help! Since there are so many volunteers, you won't be overloaded with calls. I've had it for a month but have only received two calls. Somebody else beat me to answering the first one, but I was able to get this one first. The calls ring on the phones of multiple volunteers and the first one to answer gets to take it, so no one is left hanging if you can't answer."
"I have had several calls on this app: From helping others to find their landmarks on streets tbey are familair with, to assisting them going thru their mail, to making sure cooking directions are followed.  This app a TREMENDOUS IDEA!  Its an amazing opportunity to be able to help people from your mobile phone.  I am hoping they can improve the digital quality of their calls (it is afree app so its dependent on donations *Fingers crossed*) as a person in need asked me check to the quality of their cooked meat & the video call was alittle to pixelated.  But given the temperature they cooked at for the amount of time they cooked at their meal was safe.  This is great app to download and then ‚Äòsign in‚Äô when you know you got sometime to help & ‚Äòsign out‚Äô when you cant.  I cannot rave about how tremendous of an idea & app this is üíôüíô"
"I love the idea behind this app. Truly I think that it would be absolutely great, if only the video quality were better. I've answered a dozen or so calls since I've had the app (for about a year and a half now) and sometimes it is REALLY difficult to answer the questions being asked because the video is too blurry, pixilated, or freezes up. A couple times it froze and an error message popped up saying that there was a problem and I was going to be disconnected. It's just so disappointing when that happens. I'd love to be able to answer what's asked with more confidence, but this app needs better video quality for that to happen. 
Please make this a priority! I really love receiving calls and helping make someone's day run a little more smoothly. Cheers."
"I‚Äôve read the stories on the app and noticed a theme. People say ‚ÄúI was hesitant to use that app to ask for help‚Äù and the other people say ‚ÄúI love it when I get the chance to assist someone.‚Äù 
I totally identify with not wanting to ask for help. When I was younger I had my pride and thought I could do everything myself. Now that I‚Äôm a little older I realize it has nothing to do with pride. My time is valuable. If asking for help saves me grief and time then yo better believe I am asking for help. There are 17 volunteers to every low or no vision user, so don‚Äôt hesitate in asking for help. People volunteer because they want to. You‚Äôre not going to be bothering anybody. 
I got the app two weeks ago and am excitedly waiting for my first opportunity to help"
"I love this opportunity to help people even though I‚Äôve only received about five phone calls in two years. That‚Äôs a good sign there‚Äôs probably enough volunteers. I‚Äôve enjoyed helping three different people in different circumstances needing help.
One gal needed help as she opened a new box of tennis shoes to make sure she got what she bought. 
Another young man asked me to help read some packages so he could finish making homemade cookies.
Another older gentleman was sneaking outside to have a cigarette with a friend and dropped his lighter. It was a dark and it was pretty funny trying to find it, on the ground with his phone, and then tried to direct him towards picking it up. His left was not my left LOL
it‚Äôs a great app and I wish more people new about it."
"I love that I can help others in just a few minutes, when truly needed. We all have something we need help with, but it‚Äôs not always easy to ask or for others to be available. We might offer to help others but not really know what they need. This app reaches out to several people and they only answer when they are available. I‚Äôve answered a few calls now and had others beat me to it a few times too. I look forward to the calls and hope those using it to seek help know that they are appreciated.  I live in Japan and receive about two calls a week between 6 PM and 8 PM. It‚Äôs usually early morning for the person calling as they prepare for their day."
"I could not think of a more valiant way to use your phone to help others for free. No ads, no deceitfulness, no monthly charges. No gimmicks or tricks. Just a clean, true
to purpose app in which people needing sight related help can call upon willing volunteers in real time. If you are busy, you don‚Äôt have to worry because of the vast amount of volunteers, the call will get answered. In fact, once you help a person or two you‚Äôll be scrambling to answer that special ring! There‚Äôs no better feeling than helping another living being. The developers of this app should be knighted or gifted houses and cars or something. I hope they continue making these rare gems. Maybe bring back Yitien! Lol"
"I have only had 2 successful calls and the third was disconnected while the gentleman asked to to help him at a convenient store. 
All three times I could feel a connection of one human helping the other. They were all very kind and we joked a little. It‚Äôs an imprint on my heart that I‚Äôll never forget. I have been a member for a few years and only had a few calls. So don‚Äôt be too discouraged if it takes awhile to get a call, or if you get to the request too late. It will happen and when it does it‚Äôs humbling to be able to help someone in that way. 
Thank you be my eyes! I am honored to be a piece of such a wonderful organization. Much gratitude to whomever created this app. Bravo!!"
"I‚Äôve never written a review, but this one has to go up.

I signed up on the app almost two weeks ago where sighted volunteers can assist visually impaired people across the globe in their day to day activities. 

Funny enough, just last night I was wondering that my phone hasn‚Äôt beeped till now and I woke up this morning to my first call where I had to identify the colour of the trousers that a lovely sounding visually impaired lady had to wear today. I was excited for my first call and I honestly didn‚Äôt want to mess it up for her. The video quality wasn‚Äôt too good and I couldn‚Äôt tell blue apart from black, so she promptly held up the trousers against the light to help me identify the right colour. It was navy blue :)

It didn‚Äôt take a lot of effort or time and I might not have made a much of a difference, but I haven‚Äôt felt this good or even helpful to my ecosystem in a long time.

If you also want to contribute to your ecosystem and help someone else‚Äôs life get a tad bit easier, I would highly suggest you download the Be My Eyes App. I for sure can‚Äôt wait for my next call!"
"I‚Äôve had this app for a year and have yet to successfully answer an incoming call. Either I accidentally swipe down when it‚Äôs supposed to be up, or left when it‚Äôs supposed to be right because there‚Äôs never an indication of what the right action should be. And since you only get a call about every 8 weeks it‚Äôs pretty hard to just remember.

Today I got a call and finally made it to a button to ‚Äúanswer‚Äù....pressed it frantically and nothing happened. Still couldn‚Äôt pick up a call. There‚Äôs a app message saying I need to enable my microphone and camera‚Äî- they clearly are for this app.

This is the first review of an app I‚Äôve ever bothered to leave because I love the premise of this app and would love to be able to assist a blind person. However all this app has successfully done is ensure that I regularly hang up or decline a call from a blind person."
"I just had my 1st phone call and it was a beautiful interaction! We got to chatting after I assisted her and I asked if I could be her go to person and she said that the app doesn‚Äôt allow that. It just randomly picks who it calls. If that is not the case, I would love to know how to tell the next person that I bond with, that there is a way to do that. If that isn‚Äôt a thin, I was wondering if on the next upgrade you folks could maybe make that possible? Could someone choose us as a favorite to call? Maybe put a heart next to our name or something of the sort? I‚Äôm still giving it five stars Because I think this is a beautiful and app but that would be such an added bonus. 
Warm regards,
Jodi L. Risden"
"I have only use this app I handful of times, but every time it was a huge help. The most memorable was when I decided to use this to find out my babies gender. The woman helping me seemed genuinely delighted to tell me, and it took all of the pressure off of me with friends and family wanting to be the first to know. I didn‚Äôt have to choose who would read the gender reveal to me. I wish this app could expand to include a social network. I think it would be huge if people were able to build a report together, and it wasn‚Äôt just at random. That way more visually impaired people would feel more confident using this service. Overall I love it"
"I downloaded ‚ÄúBe my eyes‚Äù yesterday. Got my first phone call today from a sweet girl who was trying to find a salad in a grocery store refrigerator. I could tell that she was nervous when we couldn‚Äôt find it right away. I told her, ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm here! No matter how long it takes!‚Äù
We finally found her salad with the help of a store employee. Turns out that they had rearranged where she usually was able to find it. It was in the very back! 
I not only appreciated the call, but I got to experience a very helpful employee who was extremely kind when helping her. It showed me that there are actually kind people who are willing to help, and that we are all in this together. 
5 stars. This made my day. :) :) :)"
"I love the idea behind this app. I‚Äôve had it downloaded for several months now and I‚Äôve gotten 3 calls so far, so it‚Äôs not something that happens too often. The first two calls were answered by someone else, but just the other day I got to assist for the first time. This is a small way I can help others without having to interfere with my schedule or plan it out. Do you have time to help? No, then okay, no big deal. If you do, awesome! I only wish more blind/low vision people knew about it. Perhaps some sort of additional outreach? Though I guess it‚Äôs a good thing that there are so many volunteers. It‚Äôs a great cause and I‚Äôll continue to wait the next time I get to be of help."
"I don‚Äôt even know how I heard about this app, maybe on television, but I just signed up yesterday and today, got my first call. What a wonderful experience! The woman who called needed help reading her prescriptions. We had a little difficulty getting her to hold the camera so I could see it, but we figured it out and she was so thankful. I just feel amazing that I was able to help someone and I wanted to share my experience that other people will sign up too. 
I love it!
Update: It seems that there are more volunteers than there are blind users. I‚Äôve only had the one phone call to date and just wonder if there is a way to get this app out to those who need it."
"I had spinal surgery earlier this year and have been stuck inside my house. My passion is helping other people, and this has allowed me to do just that. Right from my house. Everyone that I have had the opportunity to help has been so friendly. I love that there are so many volunteers. That makes my heart happy that there are always people that want to help others in this world. Thank you for creating this amazing app. I have had it for a few years now, and while calls come infrequently (which makes sense because there are so many volunteers), just one every so often brightens my day."
"Such a simple (and practical) idea: Connecting people to help each other. As a sighted person, I appreciate the opportunity to help in small ways. I‚Äôve helped someone install a software update, use an automatic tea brewer, choose the right socks to pair with an outfit, and several other simple tasks. Connecting thru the phone and using the other person‚Äôs camera to see is just ingenious. The interaction is straightforward and focused, allowing the blind person an easy way to get assistance with dignity. The pay-off for me is an opportunity to put just a little more goodwill into the world, in gratitude for all the times I‚Äôve been the recipient of aid and kindness."
"A few years ago a friend mentioned this app on social media and I asked her all about it, when she explained it to me I immediately downloaded it to become a volunteer. I truly enjoy getting the honor to answer a call. I‚Äôm always a little upset when I can‚Äôt answer quickly enough, but I fully realize that another volunteer will grab it. I‚Äôve been an RN for 35 years so I am a helper by nature, but there is something so rewarding about randomly helping out a stranger. I‚Äôve received calls at work that I was able to answer and I‚Äôve had colleagues standing by watching, they go on to get the app as well. üòäüòä"
"This app is amazing. First and foremost, it is amazing to see such a concept come to fruition. To see the amount of volunteers and how much help, big or small, this app is providing (FOR FREE) is incredible. As a volunteer, this service makes me smile. When I got my first call, I was nervous, but after helping the person on the other end, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. I even got a little choked up. It just felt so good to help. 

So download this app. It doesn‚Äôt take up much space. It works well. It doesn‚Äôt spam you with notifications. But when the notification does show up, if you get the chance to answer, it could be the best thing you do all day."
"Absolutely in love with this app, but I wonder how many people are getting the help they need or maybe everyone is good? 

I have received one call since I downloaded the app. It also makes me wish I spoke more languages, as I feel much less useful because of my lack of ability to communicate in multiple languages. I am curious if there is app is truly useful, or if this is just not quite what the visually impaired community truly needs? 

More conversation with visually impaired would be good. I would love to have a ‚Äúchat‚Äù feature where the visually impaired community can just call out for ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to chat? Maybe improve connections and connect? Like a ‚Äúseeing‚Äù Facebook?"
"Have had the app for almost a year, but never fast enough to answer first. I was *finally* by my iPad at just the right moment, ready with headphones and a stable seat/table, so I just had my first call to help with. We jumped right into it with no introductions needed. It was such a heartwarming moment I got to assist with: helping to spell out letters in a book for a young girl and her sight impaired father. I can just imagine how needed a service like this would be for seemingly simple moments in a sight impaired life. As long as I have it, I will gladly use my sight to assist people, just as I hope others will help me if mine goes. Thank you to the creators for such a thoughtful app."
"I love this app! I love answering calls! I tell everyone I meet about it, it‚Äôs such a wonderful idea. I‚Äôve been on this app for a few years now. I wish more visually impaired people knew about it. There‚Äôs way more volunteers then people needing help so it‚Äôs not like your phone will be ringing off the hook all the time. I‚Äôve gotten less than 20 calls in the years I‚Äôve had the app. I have it always running so it can call anytime. I actually wish I could get more calls. The people I‚Äôve helped have always been friendly! I‚Äôve never had a negative experience or a person I couldn‚Äôt help!"
"Amazing concept! I‚Äôve only had one opportunity to assist. After my 1st Time, I wanted to help all the time! It gave both of us a great sense of joy. We worked together with such joy, great teamwork and accomplished what the blind person needed help with. On top of that, I noticed he had a leak in his ceiling he was unaware of that was huge and puckered with water. It was amazing as I‚Äôm based in CA and he is in FL. Distance doesn‚Äôt matter! It took about 10 minutes and I learned a bit about humanity and basic life necessity. It was humbling. The app is user friendly as a volunteer! I hope it is the same for the blind users! I‚Äôm an advocate and tell everyone about it!"
"I have gotten help from Be My Eyes in countless tasks, but I think they help I am most grateful for right now is the specialized help from Microsoft that is offered through Be My Eyes. They have helped me solve so many computer problems that calls to the regular Microsoft answer desk have not solved or have actually made worse. I also appreciate the every day tasks that be my ice helps me to accomplish, such as making sure my oven is set correctly, knowing colors of clothes, and helping me with printed documents. I am so grateful for this app. Thank you for a wonderful service. And thank you to all the volunteers!"
"I‚Äôm a volunteer- I signed up a little over a month ago and had my first call tonight.  The call connected flawlessly and the connection was strong.  I was able to see what the gentleman needed help with with no issues and help him quickly.  I‚Äôm so thankful for this app.  I have family members who are visually impaired.   Right now they have help constantly, but when the time comes, it‚Äôs great to know there are apps like this one that don‚Äôt cost a thing and have volunteers just waiting in the wings to help another human being.  There is good left in the world.  We just have to choose to be part of it.  üíô Thank you Be My Eyes!"
I signed up one this app as a volunteer a while ago and waited what seems like forever to get a call. Eventually I forgot about it until I received a call requesting help on a day where I was not having the best of luck. After helping and even having a short chat about where we from due to our accents we bid farewell. Honestly I smiled like a dork for the rest of the day and the call alone helped me realize that even the smallest acts of kindness can really make you feel good. I hope you download this and no matter how long it takes to finally get a call that you take it and brighten the caller and your own day.
"To all the people rating it so low because they don‚Äôt get calls. Do you realize it‚Äôs 100,000 blind people & over 2million volunteers?! Your call will come, just be patient! 

I LOVE this app! I enjoy helping people & listening to them & talking to them. I‚Äôve counted money, helped ride trains, picked out outfits, fixed computers, changed thermostats, read letters, organized clothes, sorted through old mail, & so much more! It‚Äôs always my pleasure to assist! 

I have gotten an iffy phone call before where the person was more trying to date me & then even slipped up & disclosed he was actually blind ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. I wish it was a better screening for that."
"I finally got a call and was the first to answer so I was able to help a blind man read what type of food was in a can he had, it only took a few minutes of my dad, he was very grateful, and I was very happy to help! Very rewarding. It‚Äôs also heartwarming to know that there are so many volunteers from all over the world that even though I‚Äôve had this app on my phone for months I‚Äôve only received 2 calls, and have only been quick enough one of the times to be the one to help!  The man I helped said he uses the app frequently when he needs to, so it was great! Hope to be able to help someone else soon!"
"I‚Äôm a premed student and due to my calling into medicine, I‚Äôm constantly looking for ways to serve others. This app brings forth an opportunity of sharing love, kindness and assistance. There‚Äôs no greater feeling than to serve others with no strings attached, just volunteering because you desire to, not because you have to or because it pays the bills. When I received my first call it brought such great joy and fulfillment into my heart! I encourage everyone to participate. You‚Äôll be amazed how helping others actually helps us individually via spiritually, emotionally, and purposefully."
"This is such a great resource. I work as a behavior analyst for a company that provides group homes for adults with developmental disabilities. It is a constant struggle to identify reliable community resources for people who need them, and it can be very stigmatizing to constantly rely on family and friends for help. Sharing this responsibility across so many enthusiastic users is just beautiful. It‚Äôs how natural supports were meant to work. I would love to see this system of support branch out to provide other services to people with other needs. For deafness, social skills questions, anxiety, etc. Thanks!"
"I want to love this app; as a wheelchaired person myself, I wanted to help. But I have legal training and I have read a lot of Terms of Service‚Äîthis one is using the need of its users (and probably hoping few people will actually read the TOS) to exploit the blind and low-sighted since they have their backs to the wall. The company retains full control of all content with the option to publish it as an ad, and your data will persist even if you delete your account. There‚Äôs vague wording about having your account terminated if you change the appearance of the app or website, but since they have full rights to interpret the TOS, that can include visual aids. There‚Äôs a lot more but you get the idea. I‚Äôm dismayed and disappointed that a blind person would do this to his fellow blind persons."
"I got this app the first time I seen it come out. I was excited about being able to help.  Before I could really understand the app & what was happening, I had already gotten a call. So, without knowing what to do, I let someone else take the call. Before day 2 & 3 I had gotten 3-4 more calls. I still did not know what I was doing, so I contacted the app techs and asked for help & explained my situation.  After a few minutes he came back to me, and told me I‚Äôd get it, and not to worry about it. 
     Well, after that day through the next year plus I never received a call.  So I took the app off. If the app isn‚Äôt going to benefit me, or if I‚Äôm unable to use the app to help someone else, I don‚Äôt need the app to just be taking up space."
"Everyone. Count your blessings.
Just now a tremendously rewarding experience, helping a blind woman locate individual fruit items on a paper plate, happened unexpectedly. I described the location of 5 strawberries (with stems cut off), one kiwi, and a pile of green stems using clock reference points (3 o‚Äôclock, 7 o‚Äôclock, etc). She was eternally grateful. How she accessed the BeMyEyes phone app is a mystery to me. But consider this: Our normal everyday agitations become fully insignificant when reminded of those daunting, crippling challenges faced by others every single day including today and each succeeding day into the future until the day they die.  BeMyEyes is truly incredible."
"My grandmother has lived blind since the 1970‚Äôs, an automobile collision severed both of her optic nerves. Since then she has learned to adapt and live a full and healthy life. The need for trained sighted guides is paramount for the lives of people who have no sight, trust is essential. This task requires the highest degree of empathy and selflessness. I guess the question is, how do we find the selfless folks who can donate their time from all walks of life in all languages because they not only care, but have experience helping the blind. It might be an impossible task, but one worth pursuing. Thank you for your time."
"This app is truly inspirational. As a volunteer I was hesitant at first to install. I thought I would surely have to pay for something so great. Or it would take me through a hefty process that I somehow wouldn't qualify for. But thats definitely not the case. Its so so so easy. It took me less than five minutes to get situated in the app and now I just leave it logged in and go about my day. The only thing is since theres so many volunteers, it could take a while before I get my first call, which isn't a big deal. 
This is amazing, and it makes me happy that there are people in this world willing to help others."
"As a sighted person, I feel blessed to be able to assist someone when they ask for help seeing something that they are unable to see on their own. 
I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to help several people, and it feels GREAT! Every encounter has been pleasant, and quite rewarding. 
I recommend you get this app and start helping those unable to see as well as you. 
My only issue is that occasionally I‚Äôve been unable to answer the call for help, and missed out on that rewarding feeling. 
Thanks for making this app available to all of us, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds with it."
"I am in the education field and really glad Apple featured this app.  I think this will start a whole new era of assistive tech!  I‚Äôm not sure if there are safeguards against any misuse-maybe someone else can comment on that, but I truly love it. If you are multilingual, you can add other languages you speak to broaden your ‚Äúassist circle!‚Äù
I got my first call yesterday and helped someone describe the color of two different garments.  The call used their camera and voice only on my end. It only took about 30-40secs for the call. I was so nervous but also happy to help.  Really cool use of current phones for assistive tech!!"
"I truly love when this app rings! It‚Äôs such an honor to be able to help the callers. My only thing  I don‚Äôt like is sometimes literally in seconds someone else answers lol I know it‚Äôs not a bad thing I just really enjoy assisting them. 
It truly humbles you to see how we take basic daily things for granted. Something as simple as putting food in an air fryer or reading a receipt. 
I will Always be a part of this app to help as long as it‚Äôs active. Kudos to the creator! God bless you for helping these amazing people. God bless all of the millions of volunteers around the world."
"I downloaded this app on a whim about a year ago, and expected it to be very buggy and not of much help to those who need it. I applied as a volunteer and the first call I received, I was able to help an older gentleman read a text. Since then, I‚Äôve received a couple more calls and I‚Äôve never felt more rewarded in my life. I know I‚Äôm not doing anything that deserves praise, but I am so grateful I get to help people in this way and I get to connect with people from around the world. I hope this app grows and expands, and can‚Äôt wait to see how it improves."
"I was amazed to find such an app and upon downloading was thrilled to see such a community thriving.  I decided to become a user.  While I have not used the app for my own sake I do know I will need it in the future.

Upon listening to the testimonies of users and volunteers helping people with various everyday tasks from picking out wardrobe, makeup, to computer issues and setting up household items like a TV or having a picture described in a museum.  Such stories were inspiring to me and I was moved to volunteer.  

This is where my rating finds itself at three stars.  I‚Äôve become indifferent to the app altogether.  I want to use the app.  But at the moment I want to volunteer.  Had I known I only had one option upon creating an account I would have signed up to help my brothers and sisters in darkness shine a light into their world.  Because I am not allowed such freedom I have given the app this rating.  

I know as a user I will need assistance eventually as my vision gets worse.  Until such an alternative is given for volunteers and users I will leave my rating as such."
"I found this little app one day a few years ago, and thought what a nice little thing I can do to help others. Turns out this is one of the biggest things I do for me.  I‚Äôm always so amazed as to how truly appreciative the people you help are.  It could be just a simple thing like which shirt is the yellow one, to helping someone finish updating their computer.  I always feel like it may have been just a little thing to them, but for me I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm the big winner when the call is over."
"This app is truly amazing! I love getting calls, it is so rewarding to be able to help someone. If fact I had a call today that really made my whole week. A nice lady called needing help identifying her mail ordered medications. After I help her she was so gracious and said some nice things that made me a bit misty eyed. Just a few mins of my time saved her an embarrassing trip to the local civic center. We can take so many things for granted, and this service reminds me to be thankful for the simple things. I‚Äôm thankful for my sight and that I can use it to help others. Hope you choose to do the same :)"
"I have used this app for a year now and I love the concept of being able to help people. I have set my languages up for Spanish and English. I have not taken any English calls and always get Spanish calls which doesn‚Äôt concern me.

Some of the calls I get are people asking if I can read signs for them, Count money for them, read blood glucose readings, and so on. 

I don‚Äôt know why but the whole month of November I have been getting strange calls from people Spanish speaking asking me questions about how they can find me, where I am from, what‚Äôs my phone number or FB name. It‚Äôs making me want to delete the app. I have reported the calls but I haven‚Äôt received follow ups it makes me wonder are they really taking care of these people accounts there probably not blind at all. 

The last call really freaked me out he was whispering and very creepy and asking me all kinds of questions like if I am alone, if I like to party where do I live when I repeated to him how can I help you ? He said ‚Äú ohhh you can help me plenty it‚Äôs all ready for you. It grossed me out so much I hung up immediately and reported it. 

Use at your own risk I‚Äôll be deleting this app unfortunately."
I am blind and use every day! ThisHelped me when my voiceover quit working on my computer I called probably around 20 people throughout two weeks and they were so kind and helpful. This is help me when my alarm clock stopped voicing and the alarm like dots didn‚Äôt work I call people every night for a month and they were so helpful. One night I was having a really bad panic attack and I called someone and explain situation they talk to me for five minutes because this is the only way I know how to get a hold of someone quickly.
"First of all, I love this app. I‚Äôm only giving a one star review to get the developer‚Äôs attention because the video quality has been terrible for the last couple months (probably about 5 calls). It‚Äôs really difficult to help people read or decipher things when I can‚Äôt get a clear image. I‚Äôve reported problems when asked after each call but haven‚Äôt seen any improvement yet so I wanted to note it in my review. I‚Äôve still been able to help a little bit, but it‚Äôs been tricky. The video quality wasn‚Äôt as bad when I first started using the app so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a problem with the app and not my phone. For the record, I‚Äôm using an iPhone 8 and have good LTE and WiFi in my house where I get most of my calls. If this is something I can fix on my end, please let me know. Thanks!"
"After having this app for a few years and missing calls by a few seconds, I finally had my first call and it was an amazing experience to help someone who needed me. Even though I was a bit nervous, it went incredibly well and my caller was so thankful. Yet, it was a humbling experience and afterwards I had a lump in my throat and needed a few minutes to compose myself. To help a stranger was well worth the wait. Please if you‚Äôre on the fence, take the leap to use this app to help another who needs your eyes. It is so worth it!"
"I would like to say thank you for all the wonderful help I have gotten from the B my eyes volunteers of helping me in my daily life
There‚Äôs been many times I‚Äôve been out and about needing help to read signs or addresses and they‚Äôve been very helpful with that I thank you so much for the wonderful kindness of everyone to support the friendship and the excepting me as of helping from all across the world it‚Äôs been wonderful to meet new people thank you so much for your help"
This app is amazing and truly inspiring. Being able to help someone see is amazing and leaves you with such a good feeling. I‚Äôm always more than happy to help. I once received a call from someone while I was driving. I answered then pulled over to help. The lady said no it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll call someone else less busy and I replied with it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm pulled over safely and I‚Äôm more than happy to help you. Long story short I helped her find the can of food she was looking for and was extremely grateful and thanked me a million times. Thank you to whoever created this app. I love this app and will always recommend it
"This is such a beautiful app. I am not blind, but my ex‚Äôs mother is deaf and legally blind, and I know how much of a challenge every day tasks can be. She still has some eyesight remaining but everyday tasks were increasingly difficult as she lost more of her eyesight each and everyday. I am so glad I can help someone who needs help and now can not be as stressed out when it comes to something like grocery shopping, laundry, or even going to test out a new shampoo and conditioner. The creators of this app are genius, and honestly this app can make miracles happen to those who deserve it the most."
"I have been a volunteer since May but answered my first call today! I was able to assist a lady in Chile, who spoke Spanish, to read the medicine she needed to take, and the dosage. She told me it was her first time, and asked me what kind of other help could she get, asked me if she could get help with colors on clothes, and if she could access help 24hrs a day. She was so pleased to know we can help her with anything she needs help seeing, and that she had support all day. There are more volunteers than the blind, so you will not be answering a calls everyday. The more help there is the better. Please download this app‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I‚Äôve had the app installed for months as a sighted volunteer.  I‚Äôve had four alerts - for the first three, other volunteers beat me to the call.  Today, I was finally connected with a user who needed help choosing the correct program from the touchscreen display on his elliptical machine.  It was an overwhelming experience.  I couldn‚Äôt believe how emotional I felt, given the chance to lend my sight - something I take for granted every day - to someone who lives every day without it.  This app makes use of our technological connection to other people for a truly noble purpose.  Bravo!"
"I found out about this app on Twitter and downloaded it immediately. Within 2 days, I received a call to help someone confirm the color of their outfit. I‚Äôve only been called twice but the feeling of being helpful has stayed with me since I downloaded the app. The notifications come through like a ‚Äúcall‚Äù so you can‚Äôt miss it and the interactions are really short. I can‚Äôt wait for this app to in every country in the world and look forward to more of us being helpful."
"First of all thanks for such a great app, specially for the update that lets us choose primary language. It gave me the courage to finally start! Cause I thought I might not be able to understand other languages well. But since I started, I couldn't answer any calls, the screen shows ""answering call..."" but nothing happens and I have to end call. After the latest update I couldn't even open the app, and I wanted to know if the app is restricted in some areas or maybe facing filters? I'd be glad to help people if you can fix that :)"
"My Grandmother, who was my best friend, lost her vision to Macular Degeneration and was blind her last 10 years of her life. She embraced it with the positivity that the embraces every other aspect of her life, without complaint. But there were daily routines that were so very hard for her and though she didn‚Äôt complain I know she didn‚Äôt want to constantly ask us for help. This app would have been a miracle for my sweet Granny and I answer as many calls as I can to help others in her honor. Thank you for making this a possibility for the vision impaired and for people like me!üíõ"
"I wish I could get more calls, but I see volunteers outnumbered the people that call for help (which is a good sign after all üòä)
The only thing I‚Äôd like to change is the ringtone, for how high my phone volume can be, it‚Äôs still very not strong and you can easily get the call too late or miss it completely, especially when there are other noises around me like TV, music or I‚Äôm in the street with the phone in my pocket.
Overall it‚Äôs a great idea and app, people that I answered to have always been very sweet."
"I absolutely love this and thankful for the person or group of people who thought it up. I have helped over 5 people and I couldn‚Äôt be more happy to do it. I mean I just had like my 5th call since downloading this last year. This time it was a Haitian man trying to identify dishwashing soap. He was so happy. They were teaching him how to use it at a facility. It made my heart smile and such a good morning. Please everyone, download this app. It's little acts of kindness like this that makes a difference in the world. Happy Hump Day everyone. Peace & Loveüåπüíã"
"This is such an amazing tool for both parties involved. I have blind family members and the independence they feel with the accessibility of this app is something they never thought they would feel and that is beautiful. As a volunteer this app is wonderfully designed to aid those who are blind in a simple and effective manner. The set up is very easy to understand and your ability to connect so easily without any issues is honestly amazing. I would highly recommend to anybody! Whether blind, low vision, or just somebody with a heart to help. Two thumbs up from me!"
"As a volunteer in this app, helping others out makes me feel good! My busy schedule doesn't allow me to go out and physically volunteer places, along with medical reasons. But that made me think... Perhaps you could create other ""good deed"" apps! For example, for the deaf, the deaf blind, and for other people with disabilities. I would download and volunteer for all of them in a heartbeat! I hope that's something that'll one day be considered. Anyways, this app is lovely and makes me feel so good, as I hope it does with others! Small acts of kindness like this app allows are what lights up my day."
"This is such an amazing concept. We‚Äôre already all near our phones every day, this is a perfect use for that. This would be five stars but the quality of the video calls make it hard to give help. The last call I had left both of us frustrated, the person I needed to help was walking around a street looking for a street address but the numbers were so grainy we just had to disconnect. I understand this could be a person to person problem with signal, I just hope that it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs able to be improved. 10/10 recommend, beautiful way to connect."
"I initially only downloaded this app to review it for my teenage blind niece. She‚Äôs fiercely independent & I‚Äôm always seeking safe ways for her to get assistance. This app is BRILLIANT! It is 100% safe in that you never know who is calling or even what country they may be from. I live in the U.S. but have been fortunate enough to help a man in Israel pick out matching pants & shirts, helped a woman in England find ingredients for a stew, helped determine the temperature setting on an oven and helped another with the name of cds. This is a GREAT app! I enjoy helping and this couldn‚Äôt be an easier way to help or be helped!"
"Download this app - and watch how your life changes from small acts of kindness. 

Be My Eyes is designed to have volunteers assist visually impaired individuals with daily tasks - simply by answering a call from someone who is blind or has low vision. The camera is not activated on your end, just for the individual you are assisting. I‚Äôve helped people sort laundry, pick out a tie to match their shirt, read expiration dates, and so many other small tasks that are challenging for the individual I‚Äôm working with. If you receive a call and are unable to take it, no need to worry - another volunteer will help that person instead. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling to be connected with someone from a different place, even the other side of the country, and be able to positively impact their day.

Be brave, and join this community - being another person‚Äôs eyes, even just for a moment, can make a real difference.
#BeMyEyes"
"I have always enjoyed helping others. This app is so special and I love it. Supper easy to set up and answer calls with a simple tap of the notification. I‚Äôve helped so many since I have had the app. It brings a sense of independence, joy, and peace to every individual in need of a pair of eyes. Something that so many of us take for granted. These days social distancing has forced people to be alone and this app is a great way to help those in need. I wish I could give it 10 stars!! I love it, absolutely great!"
"I have been a volunteer on BME for almost exactly a year and I have probably gotten called upon 5 or 6 times already. Twice I was at work and unable to answer, but the other times went really well! I have assisted with identifying toiletries, clothes, etc., disabling a security alarm, and even helped someone watch for cars while going for a walk. It‚Äôs a fun way to help others with very minimal effort. I have even had a good time chatting a little with some of the users. Highly recommend!"
"App is super user friendly. There's absolutely no guilt if you miss a call or can't take it...someone else will help. Love that it's an easy way to help others. My only complaint is I selfishly wish i got more calls haha but there's enough users that they're few and far between (which means no one has to wait too long for help) but i always smile when I do get a call. It's just nice to see technology help people in such a simple, positive, way."
Thank you so much for building such a creative and thoughtful app to bridge seeing and blind people. I have received one call so far and the video interface worked well and the audio was clear. I have already shared the app with my friends in the hopes that they will also create an account and be on call for future ‚Äúbe my eyes‚Äù opportunities. I hope that the future holds more opportunities for people to come together to make the world more accessible. Thank you again!
"I was know I was having a very bad day, i forget if I was sad or angry but I do remember seeing the Be My Eyes prompt my phone for the 1st time after having the app for a few weeks. I just answered it (which surprised me since I avoid all unscheduled phone calls/ facetimes like the plague. I helped a person figuring out the color of her Jordens. She was really appreciative and getting to help someone I dont know with something I take for granted literally made me tear up after. Thats what I remember most."
"BeMyEyes is by far my all time favorite app! Every time I get a notification I rush over to see if I can join a phone call. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use and makes the process for the caller and the receiver very seamless. I love the articles that are pushed out too! I do wish the call alerts were set up differently than the regular alerts just so you could distinguish the difference, but all in all love this app and recommend to everyone!"
"Someone recommended me this app. I thought about it for awhile, is my vision low enough to use this app? With my glasses I can okay. But when I misplaced my glasses, I can‚Äôt see to find them. So that is what I have used the app for. Not having to spend 20 minutes trying to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù for them has been great. 

I haven‚Äôt use this app much, because I try to always remember where I left my glasses. When mistakes happen , and I happen to misplace them I no longer feel bad. Thanks for creating this app."
"First off, I love the idea behind this app. After all, we‚Äôre all just humans living together on a planet, trying to help one another day by day. I just signed up for it yesterday and I received my first phone call today. Unfortunately, it was a group of people pranking me and laughing off camera. I am very disappointed in the app. I‚Äôm giving it one star for now because it was my first caller, but I will change it depending on whether I receive calls from people who truly need this service. I don‚Äôt know if there is a way to accurately screen the people who are signing up claiming to have a visual impairment versus a vile person just doing it for a laugh. I am hopeful this gets improved in the future."
"I was really excited to be able to participate in this program, but I have YET to be able to take a call to help out in.  First of all, this program clearly has far more volunteers than they need, which is great,  because I rarely receive a notification.  We are also told that calls are rerouted if a volunteer doesn't pick up.  That's an understatement: clearly calls are put out to numerous volunteers simultaneously, because I have, on several occasions, answered almost immediately upon being notified, only to be told EVERY SINGLE TIME that someone else has already answered.  I'm just thoroughly disgusted that I am not even given a chance to pick up."
"Hello. Be My Eyes is terrific. I'm not sure how to discribe it: but those who have helped me are not condescending or hesitant nor overly ""take charge"" just plain helpful and efficient.
My only disappointment came today when I contacted someone for help in taking a photo of my guide dog's newest toy to disseminate. We got the toy lined up perfectly in no time. But, when I accessed the camera to take the photo, the volunteer lost sight of the item. I suspect this modification of the appp might be impossible, or maybe even worse than that? LOL! but someting to consider at any rate."
"I can tell that the app authors have really worked hard on this app. Very simple and intuitive. I've used it since March 2015, and had about 23 alerts (roughly once every 2 months), and I was able to answer it in time about 6 times. Wonderful experience every time!

So far I helped people with mac-n-cheese directions, TV menu settings, oven temperature, clothing colors, and webpage fine-print. 

I think the only feature request is some configuration on TIME OF DAY. The standard settings only allow you to receive calls between 8am and 9pm (08:00-21:00) in your local time zone, which is fine for me. But I feel it should be a configurable option.

Also, it might be nice for volunteers to list their various skills, and then callers could optionally request skills. E.g. techie, fashion, color recognition, cooking, lengthy request, mathematics, regional info (by city?), or other special interests."
I have not yet been able to assist visually impaired person. I am looking forward to helping in anyway possible. I can‚Äôt say enough positive words about this app. This really makes me feel ease knowing my daughter is going off to college next year and no I am not going to be there with her 24/7. What‚Äôs even more heartfelt and has all of the volunteers versus the visually impaired. That goes to show that there are good people in this world that are willing to help.
"It has taken a few years to get to three calls, because there‚Äôs 4 million helpers but it‚Äôs worth it to be able to help with someone keep their independence. Calls usually only last a few moments and if you‚Äôre not able to answer someone else usually picks up right away. Calls are usually just help seeing a website that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúagreeing‚Äù with their screen reading software, reading a piece of mail or even reading a title off a CD."
"Being able to help people like this is such a rewarding experience. As an endlessly busy person, it‚Äôs easy to get wrapped up in my own world trying to juggle everything I have going on at once. This app enables me to give back from anywhere at any time. I‚Äôve helped someone while riding the bus to work. I‚Äôve helped someone while cooking dinner in my kitchen. I‚Äôve helped someone while browsing the aisles in Target. If I could, I‚Äôd put myself at the top of the list to be called on more to help. That‚Äôs how much I love it every time."
"I‚Äôve been a member for several months now and have answered many calls. I love just helping someone with basic needs and questions. The first call is always the most nerve-wrecking but every call since then has been easy. Just be very clear and give them direction if you can‚Äôt see something clearly (raise your phone, turn it upside down, move left/right). 

I love this app and helping those who need it. If you‚Äôre reading this, I hope you love just giving back to others."
"I got my first call last week and I thought I won a lottery. Its pretty great and excited to be able to help and using my own eyes to make life a bit easier for those in need. I missed total 3 calls since I got the app in December, I couldn‚Äôt get to my phone fast enough. Felt a bit disappointed but there are others online waiting to help so if you missed a call, it automatically goes to the next volunteer. Awesome app to do volunteer anywhere on your own phone.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I just installed this a few days ago after reading about it on Facebook. I got my first notification today and picked it up. I talked to a lady in California (I‚Äôm in Florida) who was having trouble with her dryer because someone had changed the settings. It took just a few minutes for me to figure out what she needed to change, and explain it to her, and she was good to go... but I‚Äôve had a happy glow all day knowing that those few minutes of my time were really helpful to someone I don‚Äôt even know!"
"I received my first call a couple days ago after 2 months of signing up. I was at work when I received the call and I answered right away & I was able to help an individual organize her mail. She was really happy I helped her with that, and I was so happy and excited that I was able to help. It really warms my heart knowing this app exists where I can offer a moment of my day to help someone who needs my help. I love this app and I can‚Äôt wait for another call üòä"
"Love the peculiar sound of the app when someone needs help! I have helped a musician, people that need me to see if the medication they are about to take is the right bottle, see the correct measurement of insuline, look for an object lost in the floor, make sure the color of their socks is the same, see the number of the pages in a brochure for a college professor. Beautiful app that leaves you as a volunteer, feeling great. (I signed up for Spanish and English)."
"I am proud of the human race when an app like this is developed. It‚Äôs so simple and easy to respond to someone who may simply want to know if their chicken is fully cooked before they eat/serve it. 
You won‚Äôt be inundated with calls either. I‚Äôve been available 2-4-7 for almost a year and have only had one call come through before another volunteer answered first. There are almost a million volunteers for approximately 80,000 app users who are visually impaired or blind. 
Sign up! #LovingAction"
"I was so excited when I saw a Be My Eyes incoming call!! I got Debbie from Anchorage AK! She needed help locating a red onion. I guess I just needed to be needed. Since that call? I‚Äôm lifted in a way I wasn‚Äôt before helping my friend Debbie. I didn‚Äôt let on‚Ä¶too much‚Ä¶on how overwhelmingly happy it made Me to help her. Can I keep her?  I‚Äôd like to be her personal ‚Äúeyes‚Äù for real! If that‚Äôs a thing y‚Äôall do?? Hook us up please? If she‚Äôs amicable to the idea of course!! Thank you for one of the ‚Äútimes of My life!‚Äù Sincerely, Linda Jackson"
"I love the idea of this app and I love that there‚Äôs people out there needing help and they can get this app and then have help. It‚Äôs a fantastic app which is why I gave it 4 stars.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because when you do receive a call if you don‚Äôt answer quick enough it goes to another person. For instance I just had mine ring and it rang for literally one second and I answered and it said ‚Äúsomeone else has answered this call‚Äù which is disappointing because I was so excited."
"I‚Äôve had the app for about 6 months and calls don‚Äôt come through very often. I think I‚Äôve only had one other call that I couldn‚Äôt answer because I was working. Today was the first time I could actually answer a call and the call was from a man who needed help sorting through his mail. I was kind of nervous but he was very sweet, super patient, and thanked me profusely. I highly recommend downloading the app. It‚Äôs really simple but it could make someone‚Äôs day like it did mine. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I've had this app for a little over 2 years now and it's wonderful. The concept is fantastic, the interface is fault-proof, and it's very simple to use. It's even better when the person you're talking to is actually interested in having a brief conversation. But sometimes that's not the case, and that's totally okay- we all have busy lives. Easy to stop what you're doing for a few minutes to help. No excuse not to have this app! Everyone should get it and help. Thank you for creating this!"
"I don't need more pressure. That's why this is perfect for me. I don't have to worry about not picking up if I am at work or just don't feel energetic enough to answer. The call just goes to the next person after a few rings. 

Also I don't get more requests than I can handle, since there are so many of us volunteering. Another thing that works for me is that when I do help it typically only takes a few minutes. 

Such an easy way to contribute. I would never be able to volunteer otherwise. Brilliant idea. 

Just having the app and knowing it's there makes me happy because this is the kind of spirit that makes the human world great. We need these reminders that our collective human spirit is expansive, imaginative, collaborative, and can be gently beautiful."
"Not only have I been an assistant to my local blind/visually impaired community for the last 30 years, my clients have turned me on to this wonderful application. 

My clients have always contacted me via Skype or FaceTime to help them and it was always with consideration when I was free. This application allows them, as well as over 100,000 others, the opportunity to call when they need it for small or big needs. 

It‚Äôs truly a blessing to have my own sight yet it‚Äôs even more rewarding helping others, who otherwise, wouldn‚Äôt have help at all. 

Encourage those who have kindness in their hearts to use this application‚Äîit allows independence and privacy for those who need it most!

And a big thank you to the developers of this application. You have opened a world of independence for those who need it as well as satisfaction who can help."
I love the concept of the app ! I‚Äôve helped about two people so far since I‚Äôve had the app but it‚Äôs very frustrating when you don‚Äôt make it easier for people to answer . I can‚Äôt even answer it on time because I have to unlock my phone & by the time I do that it‚Äôs being passed onto someone else which is a huge disappointment especially when you look forward to answering & helping others . So please fix that ! It should be easy to answer as if it were FaceTime or even Facebook FaceTime .
"I absolutely love being able to help those in need whenever they need it. This app makes those connections so easy and so quick it‚Äôs hard not to download it. I‚Äôve been a member for 3 years and have only answered 2 calls, but those two calls have made not only a difference in their lives, but they make my life that much more fulfilled as well. I love having this app and being able to connect easily with people of all kinds who just need an extra set of eyes."
"I just downloaded this app yesterday after a friend posted it via his IG story. Got my first call today and wow!!!!!! It feels great to be able to help someone who needs help! Such an innovative way to contribute your time and help other while being in the comfort of your home. love the fact that it‚Äôs mobile so it‚Äôs easily accessible. 

I highly recommend this app/organization. I would love to see this program implemented in other ways such as helping someone deaf communicate with people, or to chat with the elderly as I know family members are too busy to call and they can get lonely. etc. 

I had a lovely conversation with nick who recommended me places to visit, talked about how a place used to be during his time etc. wow what a great talk. I LoVe this app! 

Thank you to the creators! Much love from Hawaii"
"I love to help people, this app is amazing. I‚Äôve had 5 calls and answered 3. If you can‚Äôt answer that‚Äôs okay there‚Äôs 1,000s of other people that will be called in line after you until call is picked up. You can even turn the other phones light on so YOU can see what person is asking about. Very kind people. Could be a quick 1 minuet what color is this to a long heartfelt conversation. I love this app and it‚Äôs members. Hands down üîü out of üîü"
"This is such an amazing app and you are probably thinking I mean amazing for those who are vision impaired‚Ä¶.no I mean amazing for me who is not vision impaired. I get to be blessed and help a fellow brother/sister out??? That‚Äôs an amazing gift to me. I feel like I‚Äôm always looking for ways to help others/bring people together. This app is so convenient, so simple to use and makes such a huge impact. It is a community helping each other out. I feel blessed to be part of the BME community!! üíôüíôüíô"
"Every time I‚Äôve received a call I was driving, but this time I was actually stationary and ready to help! As long as you can verbally explain things in detail and not come off condescending and love to help people, download the app! I get a call maybe once every few months. So don‚Äôt expect to be a call center for the vision impaired, because calls are few and far. There are over 2 million helpers and 124k blind users with the app. So you can understand the delays."
"Not only is this app great for anyone who suffers from blindness or visual disabilities, it‚Äôs great for the volunteers too. It fills my heart whenever IÔ∏è help someone, whether it be with mail, picking out an outfit, or other daily things.  I‚Äôve seen plenty of bad reviews saying they‚Äôve never gotten any calls, but it took me over 3 months to get my very first call.  It takes time because there are over 1 million volunteers and less than 100,000 blind people.  You‚Äôre not going to get calls everyday!!"
"So be aware that you will not get calls with any amount of frequency.  There are WAY more helpers than people that need help. And that (ultimately) is a good thing.  The tasks I‚Äôve been asked to do have all been simple, no one is asking you to do their taxes or anything.  Be patient, they can‚Äôt see so the camera might need to be adjusted.  They might not be able to hang up, they also might not know you‚Äôve picked up the call.  Say hello first."
"this app is truly amazing and has a great purpose, but it gives me too much anxiety to function. a very nice man asked me to translate a password for him to get into some sort of program, and he did everything he should have and could have done. i just get too afraid and anxious to be able to properly help, i think i get scared because i know subconsciously that these people can‚Äôt help they‚Äôre blind and struggle so much because of it and that thought is too much for me to bear. if i could go back i would‚Äôve helped him out better because he deserved so much more than me, and for anyone who has that type of anxiety towards these situations please don‚Äôt download it because someone who can help will happily do the job for you, it‚Äôs okay to not be able to help out sometimes, just remember that :)"
"I ran across this app through a Facebook post. It was super easy to set up and sign in. I was concerned about ‚Äúdoing it correctly‚Äù when I received a request but the app shows you how you will be notified as well as what to do next! I got my first request while preparing for dinner. All he needed was checking mail. Simple act, he was happy, I was happy and we both continued our day. If you‚Äôre even considering using this app, please do. You won‚Äôt regret it."
"I am so happy that I came across this app. I have only answered a few calls but just knowing that I helped make someone‚Äôs day a little easier is such a rewarding feeling. I have a blind cousin so I know the hurdles they cross each and every day. God has blessed me in many ways, so helping others just seems like the right thing to do. Thank you Be My Eyes for letting me be a part of your wonderful app. Debra Baldwin Coffeyville, Kansas"
"I downloaded be my eyes a couple years ago with zero expectations. I have some vision issues and have been told I will eventually go blind, so I figured I would help while I could. It started very slow, maybe 2 calls the first year. Now I average a call per month. These calls have ranged from helping with outfits, reading bills, and my favorite, a positive pregnancy test. Be my eyes has been such a reward and blessing for me!"
"It‚Äôs the little things that mean so much to those who are less fortunate. It‚Äôs so easy and it‚Äôs beneficial for both sides! Such a satisfying feeling knowing you can help someone through the phone! I highly recommend, it doesn‚Äôt take up any time, I downloaded it, leave it active, even if you‚Äôre just chillin at the park or something, & if they call they call, if they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt! But what‚Äôs wrong with a little help and being the helper! :) love this app, such a beautiful purpose.
-Yessica Contreras"
I downloaded Be My Eyes about a month ago and I just had my first call this morning. It lasted about a minute but I was shocked at how great it felt to help someone with a task most of us take for granted. The gentleman on the call was trying to take an allergy medication and I needed to let him know which box was the correct one. The video quality was excellent and I had no issues helping grab the correct box. I hope I get more calls! It's great to see modern technology used for good!
"I have helped people coordinate their outfits and others determine if their vacuums were still charging. The most heartwarming was helping a gentleman read his mail. I learned it was his birthday and was able to join the chorus of those who used the opportunity to make him smile and tell him how kind he is. If you‚Äôre looking for a quick and easy way to be of service to others, consider downloading this app today. It‚Äôs a joy to receive a call!"
"I just got my first call and although I struggled a bit to understand how exactly the app works I was finally able to focus the camera in on the piece of mail the lady had received and read to her exactly what it was she needed to know. So I‚Äôd say it was a success! I was nervous upon answering the call but felt extremely touched by the short but moving phone call. I really enjoyed lending my eyes, I can‚Äôt wait for my next call! Very inspirational experience, very great service this app offers!!"
"I‚Äôve been able to answer two calls and help to the best of my ability! Both individuals were super sweet and we chatted for a bit also during the call. I love being able to take something that I take for granted most days and use that to help others live more independent lives. And for everyone giving 1 stars because they haven‚Äôt gotten any calls, look at the blind to volunteer ratio!"
"I recently downloaded this app to volunteer and it‚Äôs great! I got my first notification today and there is no pressure to answer if you are unable to, but luckily I was available and the first to take the call! I was on my call for probably less than a minute, but it felt great to know that I made a difference in this person‚Äôs day. There is barely any commitment and it will not get in the way of your day at all, but it will make the day much easier for somebody else."
"I got my first call today. I was able to help a lovely woman pick out an outfit for her son to wear to church! My boyfriend was with me and he was so impressed by the app that he decided to download it too!

Edit- I brought it down to 4 stars because the call notification is sooo easy to miss. Out of the 9 calls we have received, we have missed 7.. it is so upsetting because I would really have loved to help. Please please please allow us to choose a louder call notification setting.. vibration would be an added bonus!"
"I am visually impaired and I use this app almost every day to help me match clothes, read screens and so much more. This app has made my life so much easier because I live in a house by myself with my guy dogs but sometimes I just need a little help adjusting my thermostat or finding the right pair of work clothes in the morning. I definitely would recommend this app to any blind user or even any cited user to be a volunteer."
"I made my first call for assistance today, and it was wonderful!  I needed help reading the directions for something I wanted to cook for dinner, and the lady who answered was very nice and did a great job!  I didn‚Äôt have the camera lined up quite right, but she helped me adjust it.  It only took a minute or so, but it was a big help to me!  It‚Äôs nice not to have to ‚Äúbother‚Äù friends and family for help so much.  Thank you for this great app!!!"
"My blind uncle told me he used this app to help him. He recently passed away and it reminded me to install it, and I'm glad I did. I just helped someone with their dinner, they wanted to know what canned goods they had.

To think that without this app someone would have tried to make dinner and would have had to open cans at random. Now as I type this a blind man is eating the dinner he wanted to prepare, not eat what he accidentally opened.

Thanks for telling me about this app, Dan. I love and miss you!"
"I got a call, several months, after downloading the app.

She had an old fashioned thermometer and couldn‚Äôt read it. Those are awful to read in person, I couldn‚Äôt help (feel awful about it).  I couldn‚Äôt see it well enough to read. üòî But, the system worked just the way it was supposed to - connected a visually impaired person with someone sighted. (She‚Äôd had a feeling it might not work over the video, but was worth trying)"
"I am a sighted person and I absolutely love this app.  It doesn‚Äôt constantly harass you or run ads, but if someone needs help it is super easy to answer a call.  The five interactions I have had have all been super brief and left me feeling great.  Awesome to be able to do random anonymous acts of kindness.  Everyone at the small brewery where I work has now downloaded the app and they love it too!  Great idea, good execution, and I highly recommended being a sighted volunteer."
"I cannot tell you what a gift being a part of this has been for me. I have been a volunteer since March of 2020 and I believe have answered 5 or 6 calls to date. Every single time it is the most rewarding experience. The gratitude from the callers is evident, but I have to say, the gratitude is all mine. I am lucky to have to opportunity to be a part of something so amazing and I ‚Äúsee‚Äù how together we can really be successful."
"Absolutely fantastic idea and execution to help visually impaired folks. Take the time and donate a few minutes to answer a call for someone trying to figure something out. Whether it be sorting canned food, logging into their computer, asking which milk is expired, use your power of vision to help those in need. Every call I‚Äôve answered has been some of the most wholesome conversations.

Do yourself a favor, and help out and install this app."
I know I didn‚Äôt put a title on this but yeah I will give this app six stlars if that was a thing and fact 6 1/2 stars if that was a thing because it‚Äôs it seems to be like a really good helpful app and I know I‚Äôll be using it a lot at school when I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to do something when I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to cook something read something right something I know just be helpful in general
"I love helping people and stumbled upon this app when looking up ways to volunteer. The idea behind this really caught my attention, but I was a bit skeptical about how it worked. It was until I got my first call the third day of having this app. I helped a mother read letters on a medical tube of some sort. Although it took some time to get the camera positioned correctly with such small font, she ended up getting the help she needed! Made my day."
This is such an amazing app and concept and now that I‚Äôve taken my first call and helped someone I‚Äôm hooked this is such a great way for visually impaired people to get quick and simple help for any day to day task.  & from a helper POV : I LOVE helping with anything that I can so being able to have this app where someone who needs visual assistance can easily reach out and ask questions and get the help they need is so fascinating .
"The only reason this app is effective as it is is that the number of volunteers SIGNIFICANTLY outnumber those who are blind or low sighted. I've only answered a couple of calls and I've been on this app for around a year. Even if you have an open schedule you won't be constantly bombarded with calls, as I actually will leave class just to answer one. Everyone I have met has been the absolute nicest, and I love making someone's life a little easier."
My first call I was actually scrolling Facebook on my phone and was so thrilled I tapped away! The dear sweet lady was needing help identifying cleaning products. It is such amazing technology and I praise the person/people that thought of this! I told my office mate about this app her son is visually impaired we discussed that it's a comfort knowing that when he is older there will be not only be amazing technology as this but possibly more advanced technology to help him live more independently!
"I‚Äôm a volunteer and have been for quite a while. It‚Äôs such a blessing to be able to help someone else be independent. The calls truly are to aid someone else be able to do things or find things on their own. It‚Äôs as simple as reading what type of vegetable is in a can or seeing if batteries were installed correctly. I can say this enough, this is an awesome experience and a joy to take part in."
"24 hours ago I signed up to volunteer. My sister is blind and has been for about 10 years. She uses this app when she goes to the grocery store and has found that everyone who volunteers to take her call for help, have been extremely nice and friendly. 
As she says, for someone with sight, it doesn‚Äôt seem like much to help someone who is blind. But for someone who is blind, it means the world to them.

Thank you for creating this amazing app!"
"I never rate apps, but this one deserves praise! I just signed up for the app as a volunteer last night. I thought it would probably be a while before I received a call for help, but I just got my first one. The interface was so easy to use & it was really cool to be able to help someone by using a sense that I somewhat take for granted daily. I hope to be able to help more people on a regular basis. Thanks for giving us an opportunity to help! Great app!!"
"I love the option to turn on the caller‚Äôs flashlight.  It‚Äôs very helpful for those of us who accommodate ourselves with lamps and overhead lights!  
I wish I knew whether it automatically shuts off again when the call ends...?  That‚Äôs been bugging me because it can really zap a person‚Äôs battery if they don‚Äôt realize the torch is still on.  Does it shut off again?"
This is a great app to help people. I‚Äôve helped people with putting a channel on a tv and other things. So far so good. The only reason why I‚Äôm giving it three stars was because I just got a call from a women and went ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù and the man next to her was very aggressive saying ‚ÄúSpeak to her!! Comon ask how your day was and how your doing!‚Äù And obviously I was like woah but didn‚Äôt say a word. The service cut out and she ended the call. This app can be weird sometimes. The app is to help you see not to talk and ask how my day was.
"This is fantastic. It really does give blind and visually impaired people the assistance they need. I‚Äôve had it for several months but never had the need to use it, but today I did. Wow, what an amazing thing. The only thing is though if you don‚Äôt know how to change front rear facing to front facing camera on your phone it can be a little challenging. But this is so cool, I highly recommend it. It is easy to use and it works fantastically well. Thanks to the creators"
"I am sighted. I LOVE that I can volunteer and help someone, while I‚Äôm in my pajamas at home! This app brings me joy. I have helped some one find lost remote, identified boxes in a freezer, helped dye a wig/beard for a Halloween costume, helped match colors of clothes for an interview. Helped someone know which part of a box was the top, & many other adventures. I just wish I was sent more calls! Get this app; it really makes your day! üòä"
"I‚Äôve helped someone set the right temperature on their oven; determine what color the shirt on the hanger was, and provide movie start times from a video screen that weren‚Äôt audible.

Quick and easy each time, and if I were sight impaired I could see this being a great help to know there are thousands of US out here willing to ‚ÄúBe My Eyes.‚Äù

Appropriate technology and use of crowd sourcing if there ever was one."
"This app is amazing. I liked the idea of this app and how it works. I also love to help the special people with their problems. I only disliked the quality of the call. I had a caller today, and the call was disconnected due to unknown problem. I was able to hear the caller but it was really slow and laggy. I felt bad because I did not help him. I hope you guys can fix this problem."
got my first call within a day of downloading the app. it‚Äôs only been 1.5 months and I‚Äôve had two calls total. Both were great and I actually had the opportunity to chat with the second user for a while after I assisted them and it was very heartwarming for the both of us. would totally recommend for both seeing and visually impaired people. five stars for sure!
"This is by far one of the most gratifying things I‚Äôve ever done. It‚Äôs simple‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll receive a notification/call and you can help someone out in their day to day. My first call was to identify what kind of bag of chip they were about to open.  
Something so simple but it was a great feeling to know that you helped someone out.  Didn‚Äôt take much time out of my day either."
"Hello there. I have been using this app for a long time, and I love it. However, when I go to make a call, voiceover becomes very quiet as soon as I double tap ‚Äúcall first available helper ‚Äúvoiceover remains quiet until I go to the home screen. Before I go to the home screen, I have to literally put my phone up to my ear to hear what voiceover is saying. The audio of the volunteer is good, however. Please fix this bug. Thank you very much. Please keep up the good work. :-)"
"I had my first call today and the experience was wonderful. Just the feeling that you can help someone just by over the phone, the little stuff we take for granted is just a life changing experience when you can help someone with a daily task that we look at as a complaint. I‚Äôm glad a friend of mind told me about this app, looking forward to help more people with any more daily living. I recommend this app."
"It‚Äôs a great idea but I never get any calls (1-2 per week).I think they should make a setting so that people with the app open to a certain space will be routed to a call and if not enough people have their apps open, they can go to the current system. There are a lot of benefits to this including faster response times, volunteers won‚Äôt complain about no calls, and the people who pick up
Will be in a more intentional environment."
I‚Äôve never been one for volunteering for things. But when I heard about this app I downloaded it strictly out of curiosity for how it works. And just a few days later I got my first call. And it was incredible. There are a lot more volunteers on this app than there are ppl who need it so I quickly jumped at the opportunity to get on the line. And after ‚Äúbeing someone else‚Äôs eyes‚Äù for the first time I‚Äôm hooked. It was awesome. This was an amazing idea.
"I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking into it. I have been called 2x and missed the first. Second was cut short due to technical issues with his phone but we spoke for about 5 min. We were retracing his steps to look for something he dropped. We were 5 min into a 15 min walk. Super fun and what amazed me was how thankful he was, yet how happy I was to help."
"I love this app. I rarely get calls but I have been lucky enough to answer a few in the past few years. Although I get so upset when I miss a call (because it‚Äôs exciting to answer and be able to help when I can), it makes me happy that I don‚Äôt get them so often! It just means that there are that many other people who are available and willing to help."
"I love helping people with Be My Eyes.  I‚Äôve had multiple eye surgeries and am so grateful to be able to see with glasses. This is my way of expressing my gratitude. 
For some reason, this app automatically logs me out all the time, and does not allow me to save my password.  So when I get a request for help, I have to log back in, and/or reset my password; and by the time I do that, someone else is already answering the call.  It‚Äôs great that users get help immediately, but it‚Äôs frustrating not to be able to provide assistance immediately!"
"If you‚Äôre like me, you find yourself trying to find ways to help others without drawing attention to yourself. It‚Äôs about the giving, not the accolades for giving. 

Be My Eyes allows me to spend a few minutes helping someone. Sometimes people just need a tiny bit of help. I helped a woman this week determine whether the light in a room was on or off. Simple. Helpful. 

I strongly encourage people to participate!"
I‚Äôve had the app since November and I‚Äôve only had a couple of calls so it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre constantly getting calls from people so it‚Äôs nice to have. I think this app was such an amazing idea and I love helping people even if it‚Äôs something super small. I‚Äôm happy I get the chance to help people out that I never thought I‚Äôd connect with because it‚Äôs people all over the world .
"I am a volunteer and I love this app. I‚Äôve only gotten one call but I was so happy to help. I had a very sweet lady needing me to help her separate things by color. I am disappointed by the amount of negative reviews on not getting any calls. As of right now, there are over 2,000,000 volunteers and only 126,000 people in need of help. Just be patient! If you don‚Äôt have the patience to wait for a call before complaining, you shouldn‚Äôt have the app."
As a sighted volunteer I really like the ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù app. I feel like I‚Äôm making a positive impact by helping the visually impaired. I hope the app continues to make updates because sometimes the other persons video is not as clear and makes it harder to provide assistance. I also think for feedback there should be 2 questions - first about the call quality with the person & 2nd about the technological quality. Overall very awesome experience
"To the individuals who created this app, thank you! I downloaded it yesterday and just received my first call tonight! I was helping someone adjust their sleep apnea machine, they were so kind and grateful! Being able to help someone is hands down the best feeling ever. I love the ‚Äúflashlight‚Äù button on the call, it helped immensely! I love this app and have told several people about it already."
"I am not available to answer all the time, but the one time I was actually able to answer a call in almost a year, it didn‚Äôt work. The caller said he was switching some mode or something right after we said hi, and it froze after that, so I wasn‚Äôt able to help. Disappointing and frustrating. 
There were a few other calls that even tho I thought I answered immediately, said that they were already answered. How does that work? Do they ring a whole bunch of people at the same time and fastest answerer gets the call?
I still love the idea of this app and will keep it."
"I‚Äôm grateful there is an app out there where those who are visually impaired can get help with tasks the rest of us take for granted. From helping change a thermostat temperature to pulling ground beef out of the freezer. It‚Äôs a beautiful idea that someone just calls and gets the help they need, and it takes almost no time out of both our days. I love this app. Everyone should download it."
"What a marvelous idea! I‚Äôm blind, and though I‚Äôm very independent, I struggle with situations that aren‚Äôt issues for fully sighted people. For example, I frequently misplace things ‚Äî often just out of reach. After groping around, often on hands & knees on the floor, I give up in frustration. With ‚ÄúBe My Eyes,‚Äù I get immediate assistance locating dropped or misplaced items. Thank you so much for this very clever and handy app!"
"I‚Äôm a volunteer here, and I have had the opportunity to help one of the members. She needed assistance with the instructions on a package of prepared food. A small task, sure, but one that I suspect is very frustrating for many people without sight or with limited sight. The Be My Eyes interface was intuitive and the communication was smooth. It made it very easy for me to assist this young woman and perform my mitzvah for the day. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity."
"I‚Äôve had this app for quite a while now. I‚Äôve had a few call but either missed them, or someone else got to the call first. Today I happened to be using my phone when a call came though and was able to promptly take the call. It was nice to be able to help someone and make their life just a little easier."
"I joined yesterday and I just got my first call. The experience was really great and the app worked just fine. The only thing I would remark on is sharpening the camera so it's easier to see smaller words but other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about the functionality. Honestly, I'm so glad an application like this exists and I'm very happy to be apart of it."
"I met a frustrated woman today on the app because the connection was poor and the camera was blurry. I have met friendly people on this app and it warms my heart to help, but some people aren‚Äôt all that way and unfortunately couldn‚Äôt be assisted because the camera quality was blurry. I was at home on great wifi so I know I didn‚Äôt have the issue. I think the app creators need to work on making the connectivity less blurry as that is the main reason/tool for the app."
"As a volunteer on this app, it is so rewarding to help others who need it - it‚Äôs super simple and I wish there was a call back ability because sometimes I can‚Äôt answer if I am working or somewhere where I can‚Äôt hear. I also wish I could get called more often, I would love to help. What a wonderful idea this app is. Simple to figure out and use as a volunteer."
"I‚Äôve gotten probably 5 calls in the year I‚Äôve had the app but if you aren‚Äôt fast, someone else will answer! Today I was quick enough to answer and I helped someone get their movie back on after the remote had fallen and changed the channel. Such a humbling experience. So glad something like this is available for these people and so awesome anyone can volunteer to help. Highly recommend. Made my day!"
"I read the description and was immediately skeptical. I started thinking about it though, and I realized its just brilliant. Absolutely brilliant - through and through. It‚Äôs amazing to see someones good intentions follow through THIS HARD. Y'all went OFF with this app. Great job, such a usable interface, amazing people. Triple threat. I bet you guys didn‚Äôt lose a single dollar with this idea. Thank you for letting others help others! What a selfless idea üíï"
"As happy volunteer I‚Äôm always looking to give more ! It‚Äôs so fulfilling and give light to my heart to be at the service of someone else ! But there is always that lack of me thinking I can give or do more !
This app is phenomenal because I can be able to help anyone at any time not just in certain days a week . 
I know I can help someone in other part of the world and make the feel my support! 
Thanks you"
"I‚Äôm a bit of a humanist and I love helping people. When I logged into the App Store and saw the Be My Eyes app, I knew I had o download it and become a volunteer. When someone needs help the call comes in as a notification and connects to the other person ONLY if you open the notification. It‚Äôs such an easy way to help. The app is very easy to use and I highly recommend it. It feels great to help people and share a human connection."
"I‚Äôm a volunteer here and I have answered a call before. It is super rewarding and I absolutely love it. The only downside is that in the few months I‚Äôve had the app, I‚Äôve only received three calls. The call goes out to several volunteers so you gotta be quick but you know that if you can‚Äôt answer, someone will. I love this and encourage all impaired people to download this app and use it and I urge all sighted people to download and become a volunteer."
"This app is wonderful, and shows how far technology has come. I am a home health aid and truly feel that my purpose in life is to help others. This app allows me to do so much to improve the quality of life for members of the visually impaired community all over the world! I highly recommend downloading the app! My heart feels so full from the experiences I have had!"
Really interesting service. Makes me excited to use it. I haven‚Äôt been able to help anyone yet though because of the disproportionate amount of volunteers to blind people. Almost 10 to 1. I‚Äôve received 3 calls but I‚Äôve never been fast enough to answer them. Makes my heart jump every time though. I‚Äôve drop things I never thought I would drop to try to answer the call.
"After 9 months of having the app, I finally was able to help someone with their situation.  She wanted the brand name of a body mist and the amount.  After a about a minute and a half of turning the bottle in front of the camera and getting it centered so I could read it, I was able to provide the assistance the very nice woman needed.  If you want to help people and feel good doing it, download this app!"
"This app is, to me, the highest use of Internet technology that exists right now. It works well and I am thrilled to be a part of the ‚Äúhelper‚Äù community they have built. Thanks for making this brilliant public service happen!
I have a number of stories of my own experiences with the app, but will simply say that a moment of my sight is now a tremendously valuable gift I can easily give. I get as big a lift as the people I am able to assist."
"I have been able to assist 2 callers over the past year. Having 2 deaf siblings I am very aware of limitations for persons with disabilities. It can be very frustrating for them at times and not always easy to ask for help, but when they do we need to listen and help. So, I am very happy there is this service for the blind and happy to help when I can."
"First of all, what an amazing app to create I order to love the blind well and help them live their lives!!! Such a caring mindset around this app, it‚Äôs astounding. I am a seeing volunteer and got my first call today and it was incredible!! I take seeing for granted- and this app helps me use my sight for good and hopefully bring others a small amount of peace in the aid of their disabilityü•∞ literally love this so much"
I‚Äôm so happy there‚Äôs an app where I can help people when they need it. It makes me feel good when I actually help people out on this app. I helped a blind man with his microwave the other day and he was so happy that I was patient enough to help him. Sometimes it can be difficult because the camera isn‚Äôt clear enough but over all it‚Äôs just a blessing to be apart of this.
"Got my first call today... was having a bad day after talking to someone who is having a hard time with just doing common things it made he feel better ... being a service to someone else!
I told other family members about the app as well. We can definitely be of service to others during this hard time."
"I got this app a while back but had not used it before today because some other sighted person answered the call faster than I did. Today I helped a blind someone read something and it was cool to help. You can even turn on the light on their phone if you need it to see better.
Because there are so many sighted people signed up, you don't get s call but once every few months."
Whoo so i have a lot to say. First of all im eleven so the fact that im doing this is pretty amazing. 2 i came from a meme. Yes. We‚Äôre locked in our homes roght now and i just want a way to help. (not like I could do much outside because of my age but still) and im excited to help blind people and want to see their reactions for my age. Sorry if things here are grammatically wrong.
"We‚Äôve gotten two calls from people needing help reading their medication bottles. The information is blurred out each time. I‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs a privacy thing. Not sure if the issue is through FaceTime or the app itself, but it‚Äôs kind of a big deal. Obviously the people need help reading it, we‚Äôre volunteering to help. I could care less about their medical information."
"This is a great cause. I‚Äôm really excited to receive my first call, and I hope it‚Äôs at a time when I can see it and am able to take it. You guys deserve all the support that such a noble cause as this warrants. 5 stars because this is amazing, and because regardless of whether or not I‚Äôve gotten to try my first experience on your app, you guys deserve the recognition!"
This is a great app. Very easy to use and so rewarding for both the volunteer and the blind person needing a little help. Just takes a quick moment to use. Only downside is that there are not enough calls and they are hard to get. This is due to difference in # of volunteers and blind people. We need to encourage more people to sign up!
"I downloaded the app back in July of last year after I read an article about the app helping out visually impaired people and whom  I have had the pleasure of assisting. I kinda feel bad that I haven‚Äôt answered as much calls as some people, but still grateful to help out those that need my help. Thank you ‚ÄòBe My Eyes‚Äô for such a wonderful app!!"
"Once I shook off that deep-seated feeling that I'm bothering people by needing help, this app proved to be exceptional. While I frequently use all manner of text, item, money, and barcode recognizers, sometimes I really just need a good pair of eyes. The volunteers seem quite the opposite of bothered, always enthusiastic to have someone to help, and it's reliably found me someone in under a minute each time. 10/10: thrilled."
I work for an Ophthalmologist. This is an incredible app with a lot of potential. I downloaded the app yesterday and got my first call today. I went to accept it but it was too late. There is just not enough time to accept a call. My heart was racing I was so excited to answer the call and then it was gone. Wish I could have helped.
"This app along with all the people who volunteer to be my eyes, has significantly changed my life. No more depending on family or friends to stop by for help for simple things like, (Can you read these cooking instructions?) or(What color is this dress or these shoes?) or(Can you help me find something I dropped on the floor,?). The list is endless, don't know how I got along without it."
"First time, I was able to help someone out. All he wanted was to ask me to see the charging level of his power bank. Because he was blind, I was able to help directing him to point the camera at the indicator.  Just a small act of kindness but it made me happy that I could help. 

The app is very easy to use. I love the people who thought of this. Let‚Äôs change the world positively, a little at a time."
"I absolutely love this app. Whenever I get a notification that someone needs me to be their eyes I jump up with joy! 

My father is partial blind so for the past 10 years everybody in my family has been his eyes whenever he can‚Äôt see well. Then, I found this app that makes it possible to not only help one person, but everyone who needs it! 

Love love love! My honors to the founder!"
"I‚Äôve been a sighted volunteer on Be My Eyes for a year now and have helped a sweet elderly woman pick out colors of thread for a gift she was making, a man complete inventory in a small grocery store, a group of teenagers select chip flavors, and a woman set her oven to bake something at the right temperature. It is such a blessing to be able to help others! The idea is fantastic and app execution is flawless. Excited to be a small part of something big."
"I loved the idea of this application. It‚Äôs proved a great opportunity to help others. 
After using this app for several months, I realised that many of users used it for other purposes. So far I received four calls from different users, I can tell all of them are not blind because they asked silly questions about things they know all the details about.
Do not risk your privacy and don‚Äôt waste your time by using this fake app. I‚Äôm not against helping people in need, but this app is a joke. Try to find another ways to help people without risking your privacy."
"Not only does a sighted person have the opportunity to assist others with tasks and activities for which sight is an asset or necessity, but you get to meet and hear stories of incredible people. This app brilliantly brings together those able and willing to assist, and those who need a few minutes of assistance to support independence and safety. I love this so much!!"
I signed up last night and got my first call this afternoon. It was a lady trying to make chicken for her family who was out of the house. I was able to assist to get her to figure out the oven. It took 5 minutes of my time but I felt like a million bucks helping. She was so thankful. Excellent app. Easy to use and wildly helpful to those that need it.
"I‚Äôve only gotten one call before but wasn‚Äôt able to answer because I was in church at the time, I‚Äôve had this app for months to almost a year, I love the idea of this app and the amount of help it gives to people in need, I just wish I got more calls so that I‚Äôm able to help people as that is the reason I got this app."
"I have been a volunteer for several years and love this app! I have four little ones so time serving others outside my home is reduced. This app gives me a unique opportunity to love others in a small, simple way. Each time I have responded to a call has been such a bright spot in my day. I signed up to be a blessing to others, but I feel like I am the one who is blessed."
"I love knowing that I can share my sight with those who have low- or no vision. I‚Äôve assisted folks asking what vitamin bottle or food can they held, what the buttons on the new radio does, and how much cash they were holding. It makes me very happy to be able to share my sight with those who need assistance. What an absolutely genius idea for an app and I finally see some good in owning a smart phone!"
Something like this should be recommended by doctors etc. I just imagine my grandfather who was blind 40 years having something like this. This is definitely innovative and the most humbling app I have ever used! I enjoy helping those in need. Such small things have the biggest impacts! Definitely makes my day when I get a call!
"I signed up a few months ago and a month later I got my first call. I was really excited. But once the guy started talking to me, it felt more like a scam. He was talking about how he had hardly any money and didn‚Äôt know what to do. And he kept talking about it to the point it seemed like he wanted me to send him money. And he was walking around a park and he seemed to know where he was going while he was walking around. There would be things in the way and he would walk over them without using a walking stick. Like he could see... the whole encounter felt odd"
This app is so fantastic and I am so happy to be able to be of service to the blind users of this app. My father and grandfather have both passed and had degenerative eye diseases that rendered them blind so this is especially dear to my heart. I have only received one call but it was so heart warming and this is just a genius way to help people all over the world. I hope to get many many more calls! Thank you.
I‚Äôm a volunteer and have received a handful of calls over the last year. A few I missed because I wasn‚Äôt near my phone but each call I have answered I‚Äôve been able to help out with finding things and just making life a bit easier for people who are vision impaired. It‚Äôs a great passive way to volunteer a small part of my time whenever the opportunity arises.
Just had my first call and it was so easy. It connected almost immediately and the video quality seemed better than most facetime calls. Spent a couple of minutes with my caller helping him set up his tv then was able to get back to my day. This is a fantastic app not only idea but in execution. I‚Äôll be happy to answer calls whenever I‚Äôm able.
"I‚Äôve been signed up to help for three months and got my first chance to help early this morning. It was a little earlier than I would have expected (4:30 AM), but I was experiencing jet lag and was surprised and excited to get the call. I was able to help the blind participant navigate some settings on his phone. He was very appreciative and I was very grateful to help. Thank you for creating this app."
"I can finally write one about this app as I just had the absolute pleasure of answering my first call. I got to help a lovely lady named Donna. She made my day better instantly. 

I cannot put into words how amazing this app is on the volunteer side. Helping someone and knowing its instantly making their lives easier is truly a gratifying experience.

This is one app I will never delete, ever."
"The person helping describe my router did a great job of telling me what I needed to know, including which way to move the camera and being patient with my questions.  Said it was her 1st call, too.  I'm not used to turning the light on, so it'll be interesting to see if I actually develop a habit of checking whether I've turned lights off."
When I downloaded the app it changed my life forever my anger issues has gone and my depression has Ben gone my relationship with my brother are getting better and better because we always fight and when I got my first call I got joy and was filled with excitement I love the app I wish there was a donation button to give for the blind people that would be cool
"The ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù app was brought to my attention by a family member in Chicago. I signed up the next day, and got my first call about a month later. I was very happy and excited to get a call from a woman needing help matching socks. I was so thrilled to help, and I hope that I did a good job! Be My Eyes is a wonderful app, and I‚Äôm looking forward to my next call!"
I think this is a great service for those who can‚Äôt see. I‚Äôve only received 2 phone calls and they both went well. One took a little longer than the other and was a little more difficult than the other (helping the gentleman walk from one place to another in downtown Atlanta!). I am happy to help and I hope more people who need help discover this app.
"Months back, I put this application on my iPod touch fifth-generation.
Since then, I‚Äôve been recommending be my eyes to folks who are friends and family. Keep up the great work, and also keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. This helps a lot of us who are visually impaired. I also hope that you get lots of volunteers to help with the service. You‚Äôre doing something wonderful."
"Signed on as a helper. Just completed my first call and helped a gentleman from Indiana get a phone number off a business card...but had the wrong card! We chatted for a few minutes and I was able to look up the number on my computer (He said switching between apps on your phone will drop the call fyi!) 

Can‚Äôt wait to do it again."
I volunteer with Be My Eyes to pay kindness forward. My brother is legally blind and I know every interaction he has with helpers makes a difference in his life. The app is very simple and stays on mission to connect blind and sight impaired users with volunteers to solve one little issue at a time. You are literally the eyes for someone at that particular moment. The longest call I received was prolly 6 min. The shortest about 20 seconds.
"I got my first call today!  Now I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!  It took 5 days for my first call, hope I don‚Äôt have to wait another 5 days. The call was super easy and I felt totally secure that they couldn‚Äôt see or locate me. It felt so great to tell the man on the other side what the box was he was holding. That was it!  10 seconds and my day was made!  Love this app!"
Today I was able to answer my first call. I feel very lucky to have been the first of over 5 million volunteers to respond. My heart is overflowing with joy to have had a chance to help someone. Congratulations on an extraordinary program. Thank you to my daughter and son-in-law for teaching me about this program. I am in awe.
I love ideas like this. I signed up several months ago and have only got an alert a handful of times and usually someone else beats me to it but one time I actually got to answer the call. It was someone who simply needed to know which of his shoes he had put on. Such a quick and simple way to lend a hand to someone. I love it.
"Over the past few months I have had my phone notify me for 4 calls and other volunteers answered before I could, which is great because someone is getting help faster, but today I actually answered my 1st call. The people that invented this app have done such a wonderful thing for so many people."
"This app is life changing. It makes life so much easier to have a sighted person‚Äôs assistance at the tap of a button. I‚Äôm an independent person, but there are those times when sighted assistance is necessary. To have this available within moments is so wonderful. 

I‚Äôm a vision teacher and show this to all of my students. Students have cried at the freedom this app has given them."
Hello I‚Äôm a volunteer and I can think of a way to make this app better for the vollenters who can‚Äôt answer at times. Why not include a new feature where you can pause the app so you don‚Äôt get notifications. I can‚Äôt answer when I‚Äôm at school and knowing that there are people I could be helping when I can‚Äôt gets me unfocused and sad that I can‚Äôt help:( I would love to see this implemented in to this wonderful app! Chaio
I live alone and get frustrated when I drop something and can‚Äôt find it. Especially if it‚Äôs able to roll across the floor. Be my eyes has help me find things that drop. Now I don‚Äôt have to get frustrated anymore. I know I will be able to pick it up in short order and will not step on something to break it. This app is truly something wonderful.
"At first I didn‚Äôt get any calls. I thought it was a good idea but I didn‚Äôt get to try it so that kinda bummed me out. 
Today I got my first call! It was absolutely amazing. I simply chose an outfit for the kind man. However, it made really happy. It made my day!
Also, the connection was flawless and I also generally like the design of the app! 
This should be the future! It is revolutionary!!!"
"This review is from a helpers point of view . It‚Äôs been 4 months since I last received a call. I understand the odds should be about 1 in 17 that you receive a call , but it just seems like that is a long time between a chance to assist. It might be useful to see call stats so that people can understand the frequency (or lack there of)of calls, and understand what may be a normal ‚Äúwait‚Äù period ."
I signed up to volunteer with this app a few months ago and have been contacted twice to help someone. It‚Äôs taken less than two minutes each time and has been immensely satisfying and makes you feel great the rest of the day. We need more ideas like this. There‚Äôs no reason technology can‚Äôt make the world better for *everyone*z
"I‚Äôm one of the volunteer helpers and I love being one. I‚Äôve had a few calls where I‚Äôve helped people, and they have always been so nice and grateful that it makes me feel great to be able to help. I thought the idea of it was amazing from the start. I appreciate that calls for assistance are sent to multiple volunteer, so I know even if I‚Äôm busy, someone else will help out."
"I downloaded this app a year ago. Tonight I got a call from an elderly lady who said, ‚ÄúI just received a framed picture of my granddaughter as a gift in the mail, I wish I can see what it looks like. Can you describe what you see.‚Äù So I described and we chatted a little. So simple. It‚Äôs moment like this that remind me to stay in gratitude."
"I am a sighted volunteer and I‚Äôve had this app since August 2020. I‚Äôve only received about 3 calls since then and was able to help people with daily tasks. The app is totally free and if you‚Äôre ever unable to take a call, no worries, it can go to the next volunteer. It‚Äôs an easy way to help those with impaired vision via phone."
"I am so emotional after my first call for be my eyes. I read a lady her mail and we spent the next few minutes talking about the craziness of the world during this pandemic and how we were thankful to be safe and healthy. It‚Äôs free, you don‚Äôt get email ads or spammed with calls. But it makes a huge difference in their day AND yours!"
"I got this app hoping to be able to help people. I signed up as soon as I downloaded it. This was over a year ago. Today I got a notification from the app (didn‚Äôt want me to help anybody, just wanted to tell me some story) then I realized that I haven‚Äôt touched this app in over a year and not once did I ever get a request to help someone. 

Not like I even care anyway. Just thought I would leave this here too let people know what to expect from this app. I suppose it‚Äôs more useful for blind people than sighted people."
"You're never too busy to help with this wonderful organization. Just answer your call (if able), help the non-sighted with any questions only a sighted person could answer - and you're done! I am an endurance rider (horses) and always have my phone on me, so this is just perfect for me"
"I was finally able to answer a call in time to help somebody! Yay! Sometimes it‚Äôs tricky because there are so many volunteers willing to help out and answer their phone. 

I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to help a young lady distinguish various pie flavors from one another. It was funny because she put the ones she loved the best in a pile that she was going to have for her, and the ones she did not love in another pile for someone else. Ha ha. 

I love how there‚Äôs a system where there is a flashlight on the screen thst lights up the area on her phone. What‚Äôs fabulous experience! I would give it 10 stars if it were possible!

Cori"
I enrolled July 25 and answered my first call tonight by a sweet lady in Michigan it was 7pm Hawaiian time and she was up at around midnight looking at hallmark cards and needed help with them. While the camera was focusing we got to talking she found out I was an active duty soldier and then told me how her family also served in Hawaii. The call probably lasted about 10 minutes. It was an amazing experience to help someone and talk to someone new at the same time.
I love being able to help people by just taking a few minutes out of day. It‚Äôs really a fast and easy way to lend a helping hand to someone else. I‚Äôve even had some of the same callers which is fun because they recognize your voice and you bond over that small moment.
I volunteer with it and it‚Äôs such a neat idea. Seriously I got to take 5 minutes out of my day to help make someone else‚Äôs life a little easier. So worth it! The only think I wish would be that they‚Äôd give you an option to put whether you‚Äôre available or not so I‚Äôm not worried I‚Äôll get a call while I‚Äôm at work because I won‚Äôt really be able to answer.
I hope this app is advertised to schools for blind and as widely as possible. I got my first call yesterday and it went really well! A married couple who are both visually impaired needed my help reading some insurance cards. They were so impressed by the app service and we chatted a little bit after. This app is a great idea! Please market this great service!
"I know we have a lot more volunteers than people needing assistance. So we n Ed to be getting the word out to our visually impaired friends and community. And, if you are visually impaired, please use the app as much as you need to! There are so many of us out here who are still waiting for our first time to help someone! Trust me - we‚Äôre out here, so use the app as often as possible."
"What an incredible feeling to be able to help someone with something we take for granted every single day. I mean really, you have no reason to not download this app and help someone when it‚Äôs your turn to pick up a call.. it‚Äôs so easy and makes you feel good. Being nice is free.. so is helping the blind."
"As soon as I heard about the app Be My Eyes, I immediately downloaded it and signed up. I have now answered a handful of calls and have helped people all across the world! Since there a lot of volunteers available, calls are always answered very fast. This is such a great resource for those who are blind/visually impaired! I‚Äôm happy to be a volunteer!"
"I love that it‚Äôs anonymous and there‚Äôs no pressure to answer a call. Most of the time, it‚Äôs simply reading part of a label or identifying basic colors. It‚Äôs an easy way to help a stranger. It‚Äôs also helped me improve my communication skills. I recommend it for anyone who likes an occasional positive interruption during their free time."
"Such a fun way to help other people! The calls take literally 20 seconds to about 2 minutes, and it‚Äôs just simple tasks that are easy for sighted people but are an obstacle for the blind. I get giddy whenever a call comes through because there are so many more volunteers to users üòä"
"Living to love on people is what makes me, well me.... be my eyes is a way I can love on people - they call I help. The person who has reached out for my help requires trust in me - but what I get back is even better than the help I‚Äôve provided the person calling. I get pure joy from helping. This is the best dopamine hit you can get. Jeff"
"I finally got the opportunity to help someone yesterday and had such a nice time speaking with him. After we found the spice he was looking for, we talked about other topics and just had a nice chat. He even offered advice for my friend, whose 1 year old is visually impaired, as they begin to navigate this new world.  I hope I get the opportunity to help someone again soon!"
I don‚Äôt know if there is any feeling quite as good as being able to help someone. It definitely makes my day and week better to be able to help in any way I can. It makes the world seem smaller and more human that we all need help with things at times and there are people around the world willing and able to help. Love this app!!!!
"The community is so large and fast that I have only been able to respond quickly enough to 1 out of 15 calls.

I am a supporter who helped a young person find something dropped on the floor of their hotel room. It was a wholesome experience indeed. 

Smart app and great community."
"I‚Äôve assisted a few people now and it‚Äôs such an easy process.  They show you the problem ie ‚Äúwhat color is this‚Äù - ‚Äúwhich button is on‚Äù you answer the question, ensure there‚Äôs nothing else, bid each other goodbye.  That‚Äôs it, there‚Äôs no awkwardness- easy.  I can help someone just by answering my phone."
"It‚Äôs not an everyday thing but it completely turned a bad day all the around for me! 
I‚Äôve never found an app that not only helps the visually impaired but I feel awesome I had the chance to help someone that‚Äôs across the world!! Something so small that means so much to them and helps them get their their day!"
Too many volunteers. I‚Äôve had the app 1 year and haven‚Äôt been able to help anyone cause they send you the same call they send everyone else. Don‚Äôt matter if it takes me .2 seconds to click accept. Someone else always gets it. And idk why I even have the app anymore
"Amazing! Thank you for letting me be a part of such an incredible app. Every caller I‚Äôve had has told me how much the love it and how helpful it is. It warms my heart to help every single time. The only thing I would change is the ringer volume. It‚Äôs very quiet and I‚Äôve missed some calls because I couldn‚Äôt hear the ringer. But besides that, this is great!"
I absolutely love this app. It makes me feel so good just interacting with others. I wouldn‚Äôt even care if they called just so say what‚Äôs the weather today?! Lol. I wish more people would use it. I have spent hours assisting people from grocery separating to hooking up wires on the tv. I wouldn‚Äôt change it for anything. Help others. It‚Äôs important. Share love. It‚Äôs important.
"It is so satisfying helping someone by being able to describe their surroundings or something as little as helping them choose a shirt to wear. I highly encourage you to download this app and help. It takes sometime to get a call, but when you do, it‚Äôs nice to be able to help. Try it and see, no pun intended. What do you have to lose?"
"I LOVE that something like this is available. My aunt lost her vision a few years before she passed away, she was such a strong independent woman and this was such an adjustment for our family. I wish I‚Äôd have known something like this was available to help her. It‚Äôs the whole reason I downloaded the app, as a way to give back in return for all she ever did for me. Amazing."
"What a brilliant idea. I volunteered and received my first call within a couple of days. I was able to help an individual determine the power remaining on a device he was using.  I was glad to be of assistance.  And each day when I open the app on my phone, I see more volunteers joining the network.  Awesome!  I hope more people requiring assistance will try the app."
"Whoever made this app is a genius with a great heart. I love everything about this app! It is so wholesome and a great ideaü§ó.  All I ask is that everyone take it seriously, I found this app through TikTok and I find a lot of people wanting to mislead these poor souls.  Please just help them and move on, there is no need for joking or making fun! üòÅ 5 stars!"
"There should be a setting where you can choose time periods throughout the day that you can answer calls. I go to school and I cannot answer calls between 8 and 15. This would be extremely helpful, especially for the blind as to prevent them from wasting their time by calling people who have work or school schedules. Otherwise, this is a great app with a revolutionary concept."
"As a sighted user that has the joy of assisting those with limited or no sight, I can‚Äôt say enough what a joy it is. 
It makes me smile to know I‚Äôm helping someone else‚Äôs day go a little bit smoother and it really has made my days go smoother as well; a fresh outlook or appreciation for your own world can really have a positive ripple effect."
I got a call 2 months after signing up. I was in class for med school and jumped out of my chair and out of the lecture room to answer this call and it was amazing. I helped someone who truly needed my help and was so thankful! We even had a lovely conversation as if we were friends! This is an amazing concept and I can‚Äôt wait for more calls in the future
"This app has a wonderful point and seems very helpful to those in need. I just with I could be more of assistance in helping. I never get calls to help people, probably because there are over 1 million people here to assist those in need of visual help. But what percentage of people wanting to help still want to help. Is there a way to see who‚Äôs actually helping and get rid of the others? This disappoints me."
Great application.  So far I‚Äôve gotten four calls and been able to help 3 of the 4.   One call had poor sound and we could not hear each other adequately.    Such a wonderful feeling to help someone out with something as simple for me as reading directions on the back of a package or identifying what color a shirt is.     Love it!!
"Best feeling you can have is when you help someone. This app extends your ability to people you may never meet. 
I just helped someone check their thermostat settings and you know what - no matter how big or small the task, each opportunity is a chance to make someone‚Äôs day a little easier. Thanks for helping me help someone else."
I heard about Be My Eyes a few days ago and signed up for it. You help people who are blind and vision impaired do things like check expiration labels and find dropped items and etc. I just got my first call and it was a woman from Alabama who needed help identifying some spices. Feels good to help people and what an awesome use of this technology in our pockets.
Over the past year I‚Äôve received about 6 calls from people needing assistance. I‚Äôve helped people with things as simple as does this shirt match this skirt or what is the name on this perfume bottle. What a brilliant concept this is..it takes just a few minutes to help someone but the feeling you‚Äôre left with afterwards lasts a lot longer than that. üíóüíóüíó
"Wonderful service that puts those who are blind in touch with someone who is seeing. Over the last 3.5yrs I have received and answered roughly 10 calls that have ranged from identifying food in a freezer, to helping them with tech issues. I love being able to help someone who needs it!"
"I have used ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù on numerous occasions to help me out. I‚Äôm blind and no matter when I need assistance with something, someone is always there. The volunteers are absolutely amazing. They‚Äôre always very nice, polite, kind, patient, understanding, caring, able to help out, and an asset to anyone who requires some much needed sight to navigate their surroundings."
An incredible idea that has now changed the lives of millions of people. The functionality is great and I can‚Äôt tell you how rewarding it is to help out  this amazing community. If you believe the world should be more accessible for everyone then you have to download this app.
"But I‚Äôve been a member for over a Year and have yet to receive a call?

I just received my first call a few days ago! Yay! Was so happy to help this lady letting her know that her fish looked cooked all the way through! Can‚Äôt wait to help more people that are visually impaired! Thank you so much for creating this wonderful, helpful app!!!"
"Love the app but a ‚ÄúReady to Assist‚Äù option would be great on the volunteer side. For example I‚Äôm often up late at night but I don‚Äôt get connected with people due to it being nighttime where I live. I would love an option to say that even though it‚Äôs late I could still help people. However, that‚Äôs my only complaint. Great app with great people!"
I have only received a few calls as of this review but each one was so fulfilling and I actually had some great conversations after helping the user solve their problem. If you want to be the change you want to see in the world than this is a great place to start. Great idea and even better execution!
"I love the idea of this app! I would love to help people. I am able to see, and would love to help people who ask, but when I tried downloading the app it put me as someone who needs the help. And I can‚Äôt seem to figure out why or how or how to change it. I deleted it in frustration, in a few days I‚Äôll re download it in hope this has been resolved."
"What a simple and beautiful thing. I love this app so much. It‚Äôs such a simple process and literally doesn‚Äôt take more than 2-5 minutes to help someone out and make a difference in someone‚Äôs life. The people are always so thankful and that just makes me feel even better. I wish I could get more calls, I love every time I get one."
"This app is so unique, and I absolutely love it. I‚Äôve helped 2 people already, a little nervous due to the newness of it all, but I‚Äôm always happy to help!

Needs only one bit of improvement: I had no idea how to decline a call while I was busy with someone. Could the seeing eyes have a toggle for availability? Or maybe pass the call on to another seeing person if it gets declined by someone.

Thank you for this app! It‚Äôs so wholesome!"
"This is such an awesome app. 
It feels amazing being able to help others. 
I‚Äôve helped two people so far with just simple things like picking out clothes or figuring out which bag of chips they have. 
Very easy, quick, and a lot of fun!!! 
Thanks for the giving those in need this opportunity."
"I‚Äôve answered 4 calls so far, and they‚Äôve all been great. You get to help someone, plus meet nice people. 

It‚Äôs not difficult at all. Someone calls, you answer. Then you help them adjust their thermostat, find their dog in the house, or something equally no-biggie, and maybe chat for a minute or two.

Such a great app!"
"I feel like the blind people should be the ones to rate, but I had my first experience today as a sighted person and it was delightful. So happy to help. I‚Äôve been a member since July 2019 and I‚Äôve never gotten a call. My best friend, who was blind, died recently and it was such an honor and privilege to help. I hope he got it all sorted out. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Signed up as a volunteer a few days ago, and just completed my first call. I helped a lady change the temp on her thermostats. This app is amazing. Such a game changer for people who are blind. I can see how this app can be extremely useful and will definitely keep using it. Whoever created this app deserves a MAJOR pat on the back."
"This app provides a wonderful way to be able to help someone. The app has a very easy to use interface. Amazing idea.  My grandmother was blind when I was a child. Later my mother went blind due to macular degeneration. Although this app wasn‚Äôt around to help them, it can help so many people now."
"I‚Äôm a seeing volunteer and think it‚Äôs awesome I can help out in this small way.
I‚Äôve heard this app has changed the lives of the users of this app in a major way.
One user shared this app had helped her all through her college years and she would have never been able to graduate with the help of this app.
The founder of this app is to be commended."
People helping people. What a wonderful way to connect and help other human beings. The few times I was fortunate to be connected with someone a small amount of time makes a big difference. We‚Äôre all one family under the stars and this app made that saying more real.
"1) You will try and answer and someone has grabbed the call already. But don‚Äôt let that keep you from using this app

2) The feeling you get for helping someone is totally worth the wait. I have been able to help a few people over the last year. And things so basic like reading cooking instructions or reading the dials on an appliance seem simple but to the person calling you know you‚Äôre a huge help. 

Totally worth it. 

Only thing that would be cool is seeing stats and where you are in a queue for your next call.

Do your soul and karma some good and get this app."
"What an empowering tool to help with independence. I‚Äôve had great conversations with the calls I‚Äôve answered. It is definitely a testament to the power of One. How much one person, one small kind act, a few minutes of our your day can make a Big Impact in the life of someone else."
"It‚Äôs an honor to be of service. When I am busy, stressed, sad, angry, tired, or whatever... I answer the call from Be My Eyes.
Every time I see a blind person needing help, I instantly remember how grateful I am that I have my vision, and it makes me grateful to be of help. 
It‚Äôs truly a practice in gratitude, service, and personal growth."
"Thank you God for my eyes and for allowing me to be the eyes for someone! 
Please join ‚Äúbe my eyes‚Äù community!
I just had my first call and it was amazing! He was so thankful for being able to get information about an event! 
This calls take only few minutes! And the feeling after is indescriptible! There is Spanish option!"
"So I‚Äôm a volunteer and live to get calls to help.  It‚Äôs a small way to help.  My husband is a computer scientist and engineer is also totally blind, be my eyes increases his independence and when he is cooking be my eyes is as important to the meal as the ingredients or utensils that he is using.  As a counselor specializing in issues of  blindness I‚Äôve installed be my eyes in literally 100s of devices for my clients to use"
"I wish the app had a feature where the sighted person and blind person could type back and forth. This would be immensely beneficial for Deafblind people, for obvious reasons. But it would also be beneficial for any blind person who wants some information without announcing it to everyone within earshot. Texting feature, please!"
"Love this app. Always feel upset when I‚Äôm unable to catch a call in time. Sincerely wish I got more requests. Have had such genuine experiences and interactions through this. Strongly support anyone considering getting this app, there‚Äôs honestly no reason not to. Have a wonderful day!"
This app has an amazing concept.  I‚Äôve been a member since November 26th 2019.  I‚Äôve received 2 calls and have had a great experience on here.  I feel so grateful and privileged to lend my eyesight to those who are blind or low vision.  This gives me a lot of faith in humanity and truly humbled me  I look forward to receiving more calls and assuring many others.
"This app is such a great idea! Calls are typically few and far between but I always look forward to answering calls, as it elicits the same excitement level as receiving a call from Santa. Also knowing you are helping someone in the simplest yet fulfilling way is an easy way to perform a good deed of the day. Mahalo, Be My Eyes, for utilizing smart phones in an ingenious manner."
I had the opportunity to help a nice gentleman match a shirt and pants for church this morning over my cup of coffee. It was an incredible way to start my day and brighten my mood. This is an incredible app and I hope to receive more calls soon. I recommended Be My Eyes to all my friends on Facebook. This is easily my favorite app now.
My only question/issue is that when someone calls I have to swipe and press etc. on my iPhone and it never picks up quick enough. Y'all need to incorporate a fast answer/insta-connect option so the sighted volunteers and chose that option to immediately answer a call. If that's possible.
I recently helped a couple of college students sort through their mail.  It made me realize how many little things that I take for granted every day.  I am glad I was able to make their day just a little bit easier and I'm glad things like this app exist to give differently abled people a little more Independence.
I‚Äôm a volunteer on this app. This app is very easy to use and so secure....I‚Äôve had the opportunity to help two people so far and they were both great experiences and did not take much time (although I would gladly have given more time if needed). Highly recommend this and strongly suggest you share it with any sight-impaired person you know.
"It would seem every time I‚Äôve helped a visually impaired user they have brightened my day or given me a piece of joy that I‚Äôve been able to carry with me after the call!  I find myself spending more time chatting with the user than identifying what they need!  Brilliant idea for an app, easy to use and a great service to all who use it!"
It‚Äôs rewarding to be able to help someone! I got my first call today and it was very simple and it only took about 3-4 minutes. It barely takes any time out of your day and yet you make someone‚Äôs day just a little bit better.
I have friends of my own that are visually impaired and for most of them they tell me a feeling of helplessness they tend to have toward every day tasks. To have an app like this where they can easily call someone for Help no matter what time of day it is can help build back their confidence and improve their life and it's a really great concept.
"I just had my first call, there have been a couple that I‚Äôve missed and it broke my heart. It‚Äôs so amazing to know how many people are here to help others. My call was quick but such a great feeling to know I helped...I love this app and God bless those who created it! What an amazing way to serve others! Thank you for the opportunity!"
I got my first call this month. I helped a woman distinguish between the shampoo and conditioner bottles at her hotel. Was early in the morning and I took the call from the warmth of my bed in my pjs. Took less than 2 minutes. The woman was very nice. Felt good to start my day helping someone with something I take for granted. Definitely a win/win for everyone.
"Quite likely the number one most helpful smart phone app to me as a blind man. I have been able to do my own laundry, distinguish food in the pantry, label vitamins and herbs, get my computer talking again when it had frozen,  and even assemble a mini greenhouse through the help of their awesome volunteers!! Would recommend to anyoneüò∏"
"This is such an innovative way to help a visually impaired person when they are needing at the most. It takes only a few minutes to assist them, and it‚Äôs based on your availability.I just finished my first call, and it was such an enjoyable experience."
"I think it‚Äôs a good app very useful for the people it‚Äôs trying to help, but it‚Äôs not much thought behind it after that, where the explanation for how to get callers? Why is it that they can only reach out to you. I got ONE call the lady was nice, very talkative which I like we had great conversation about her kids, the life she‚Äôs living etc but I haven‚Äôt gotten anything after that, why isn‚Äôt there more detail"
"Wonderful app, easy to figure out how to answer a call. It was the coolest experience to help someone who can‚Äôt see with their computer when their voice control turned off. What a beautiful and unexpected gift it was to be able to help someone in new ways."
This is a great idea for an app! I love helping people as much as I can even in the smallest ways! This makes it even easier to help out your fellow man! I recommend this app to everyone I know! The ones who sign up seem to truly enjoy helping someone else out and it‚Äôs a great way to even make an amazing friend!
But if you can answer with a record voice it would be even better....then they can listen to it when ever they wanted...and some people may don‚Äôt want to actually call someone else to ask so they can record they‚Äôre voice so the volunteers can listen later and answer it
"Awesome app, everyone should download it as a just in case, in the 10 months I‚Äôve had it I‚Äôve only had the opportunity to help one person so if you download it it‚Äôll probably be a while until you get a call but you could make someone‚Äôs day that much easier in 30 seconds"
"This is one of the easiest ways to help others! Most calls are under a minute, but if neither of you is in a hurry, it can go longer. I helped a gal pair up matching outfits the other day and my husband just helped someone who was cooking. It‚Äôs fun and easy and so worth it!!"
"It was pure luck that I got my first call a minute after downloading the app. A lady needed help with the brand of the diapers she was holding at a pharmacy. I told her the brand, she thanked me and we hung up. It felt so good to be able to make someone‚Äôs life easier!"
"I‚Äôve had the app for over a year and finally got a call today. The woman asked me the colors of her shirt and pants and I was able to tell her and that they matched. I also helped her pick out matching socks. It felt great to help, and so easily on my part. Amazing app. I can‚Äôt wait for another call."
"I‚Äôve been able to assist two people at this point and it always makes my day better.
Although the requests are small, it makes a difference in the daily lives of people. This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used!"
"It makes me happy that there are way more volunteers then blind people signed up for this service.  It means humanity still has hope.  After a year of being a volunteer, I answered my first call today.  Something simple.  Identifying a bag of beans.  Someone is cooking beans and sausage for dinner tonight.  

Sometimes I love technology"
"I love this app! It‚Äôs a quick, easy way to put some good out into the world and help someone. The interface is easy to use, and I haven‚Äôt had any trouble with it. I don‚Äôt get a lot of calls (I‚Äôve only gotten 3 or for in the last 6 months), but it‚Äôs always a good experience!"
My sister in law Debbie was blind. We recently lost her but she would have loved to have had the chance to use something like this to help her. I am absolutely so grateful to be able to help and give back in her memory üíú This gives freedom to those who may have been unable to go and do things before.
"I had my first call today as a volunteer, and it was an amazing experience. Helped someone figure out the bus they‚Äôre supposed to go on. It was lovely chatting for a couple minutes and being able to help. It‚Äôs also wonderful to feel connected with someone across the other side of the world. What an amazing app!!!"
Whoever came up with this idea is a beautiful person and truly selfless. What a nice and convenient way to help our fellow man. I‚Äôm glad there are still people out there who genuinely want to help others and expect not want anything back. Learning of this app restored some of my faith in humanity. Thank you.
Using this app and helping others makes you think about someone other than yourself.  It helps you problem solve and think of how easy a sighted person has it.
Every call I have gotten have been the nicest people. So patient and kind. It‚Äôs such a good feeling after these calls to know you helped someone with someone that we take for granted. Sight. I will answer a call anywhere anytime just to know I helped someone. This is the best app ‚ù§Ô∏è
As long as you have good service this app works great. I won‚Äôt answer unless I do because it will really make it hard and I don‚Äôt want the person asking for help to get frustrated. Besides that it feels great to be able to help no matter how big or small the task is.
"This app is incredible! I just had my first call and I guided a blind gentleman on one of his ‚Äúdaily strolls‚Äù around his neighborhood. It was rewarding to help, I had great conversation the whole time, and it reminded to be thankful for the little things. It was really a fun experience and I‚Äôm looking forward to my next call"
"With this amazing app I have had the privilege of helping so many people! The requests are simple such as ‚Äúwhat are the cooking directions on this package of noodles?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat is the expiration date?‚Äù, and ‚Äúis this wrapping paper for a birthday or for Christmas?‚Äù. Just simple everyday things that only take a minute or two, but can really help someone."
"Immediately after signing up for this app, I started getting a ton of spam emails. Legitimately like 100 each day since I downloaded the app. I tried to sign up without sharing my email address but could not, and it was specifically mentioned when I was forced to provide my email address that it would not be shared. Clearly a huge lie. Downloaded this app to try and do something nice and am now dealing with all of this spam email. Not happy at all. And it‚Äôs probably all for naught because I likely won‚Äôt get a call to assist on."
"Becoming disabled in my forties was devastating, not the least because it made it so hard to be able to continue to volunteer and give back to others. I love that this app gives me the opportunity to help others, and that it helps me to still feel useful."
"Wow, I just received my first Be My Eyes üëÄ call this morning, I signed up yesterday. It was so nice meeting and helping someone new, THANK YOU üòä Be My Eye‚Äôs üëÄ!!! If you haven‚Äôt installed Be My Eyes üëÄ yet do it NOW you‚Äôll be so grateful you did after receiving your first call ‚òéÔ∏è Btw a logging feature would be nice to keep track of the people you‚Äôve helped üôÇ"
"I‚Äôll gladly devote time to more complex issues, but so far I‚Äôve had the super EASY privilege of letting a woman know that her milk was still good for two more days. I couldn‚Äôt believe how great it felt! This is such a GREAT premise! I can‚Äôt wait for it to be used for other needs! Old folks needing a ride, novices in need of expertise, bartering, there must be more of this concept in use!!"
"As a sighted person, I don‚Äôt get frequent calls to help, so it isn‚Äôt overwhelming. I get to help when I can and I can decline a call if I‚Äôm unavailable. 
This app helps so many, and you feel great for having the opportunity to help. 
I have had this app for something like two years now, and I‚Äôll never delete it."
I recommend every single person should have this app. When you help others it makes you just a bit happier. Be My eyes does both! Kudos the team. Keep up the amazing work!
"I think this app is amazing, I recommend it for anybody to use it. It makes you feel great to be able to just help someone who you don‚Äôt know to do something they just can‚Äôt see. I downloaded this app yesterday and got my first call on thanksgiving evening."
I cannot say good enough things about this app because it truly does help the visually impaired. They don‚Äôt always have a family member or friend that can help them and there are double the amount of helpers for these people. That way they always have someone there.
"So gratifying that I could help someone so easily, and I just signed up yesterday! I just answered my phone (it came up as a ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù call), helped a man identify some money, and that was it! There was some minor audio delay but it was still clear. Can‚Äôt wait for my next call üòÅ"
"This app takes a random moment out of your day and turns it into a way to put good vibes out into the world. It makes it so easy to help someone and it usually only takes a minute or two of your time. 

There‚Äôs no feeling like knowing that you are helping someone be more independent."
I really enjoy this app as I get to help a person in need. I often get calls nightly and feel honored to help a visually impaired person. I recently spoke to one of the persons in need and they had a great idea of creating a Be My Ears App to help hearing impaired. Anyone out there who could create such an app?  Glad to help anyone who need assistance. üòÄüëç
"I wonder why there isn‚Äôt more impaired people enrolled when there are over 5 million helpers, but I‚Äôve answered several of these calls and they are easy and it‚Äôs nice to help someone in need! Love the app!! Wish I could help more
People but this is my first baby step :)"
"maybe im a little soft or easily touched but i cried with my first experience with this app , it made me feel good and worth more than what i feel i am sometimes. I love helping people it makes me feel....needed. This is an experience i loved so much and i highly recommend"
"I rarely get requests, but when I do, it‚Äôs usually shortly after opening the app. Not sure if background refresh is causing this, or if there just so many helpers out there. Either way, the app works as intended and the idea behind it is lovely."
I am a volunteer and I just took my first call and was able to help a visually impaired person work a new light that his family bought for him! It was something so simple but it felt amazing to be able to help! I think this app is truly amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to keep taking calls and helping out!
"First off I am a sighted person. I think this app is just amazing as it allows people with vision problems to connect to a person who can see when they have an issue they cannot resolve on their own. Technology like this, used properly as it is here gives me hope for the human race."
"They can‚Äôt regulate weather the volunteers discriminate or not, and I understand that. Still, as far as customer support goes, the emailed help I received from the founder themselves was super unprofessional, condescending and sarcastic. Also, volunteers have a huge lack of sensitivity training. Make some short videos or something about how to help people before just allowing them into the personal lives of others. Too bad, because this concept is wonderful, but I won‚Äôt support such terrible business practices."
"I got my first call before Christmas and I helped a man read some coffee labels and other Christmasy type labels fr coffee to candies, it did not take long and I was thrilled to be helpfulüôè
I would only change ONE thing, my alert doesn‚Äôt let me get to my iPad or phone fast enough, ai cant figure out how to change that setting"
"This is a great App! I enjoy helping others & I enjoy answering calls. 
I‚Äôve missed a few calls by being too slow answering & I get a little disappointed. I‚Äôve answered a few calls & the other person on the other end your helping us very grateful. The app is user friendly & simple to set up."
"Thank you for allowing me to share my sight. It‚Äôs such a privilege ‚ô•Ô∏è
Also, I have a request. Under stories, I realized that all the people have countries listed for them, however, ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù is used very carelessly. 
We honestly can‚Äôt be having these conversations in 2018, Africa is a continent. Just as someone is from Canada, Africa has 50+ countries. Please correct this. Otherwise, great app."
"I‚Äôve taken two calls since I joined a few months ago.  What joy it brings me to help.  I think everyone should have this app.  The only thing I can say to someone considering joining as a volunteer, ‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù  It gives you the best feeling to help someone by being their eyes.  You will not regret it!"
I‚Äôm a sighted person who‚Äôs been a member of the app for almost 2 years. I‚Äôve only been able to take a couple of calls but I‚Äôve had great experiences. I look forward to more apps like this - connecting people in such a meaningful way.
I seemed to get more when I first signed up.     I love being able to help - most questions are so fast I can even answer at work.   I wish I could help more often.    But a great app Easy to answer the calls.
"This app and the service it provides is amazing.  I only get to answer a call about once a year due the odds.  There are several million helpers while there are only 350,000 blind subscribers.  So, that leaves very few chances you‚Äôll be able to answer a call."
"I got my first call!  I love that I get to be in service for fellow humans.  Super easy!  Call didn‚Äôt last long.  I could see how some questions could, but if you don‚Äôt have a moment- the call will be answered by someone else.  I recommend this over and over.  Spread the love üíõ"
"This is a great way to lend your abilities to others who are visually challenged. I have helped callers read an expiration date on food, describe their building so they can call for pick up, and even find Takis in a convenience store. A perfect use of technology to lift people up!"
"This app is truly amazing. I just answered my first call, and it was such an amazing experience. The woman was so kind, and being able to help her with something, even as small as whether or not she had the right seasoning mix, made me feel so good. Being able to help someone even in such a small way warms your heart."
"I never review apps, but this one is pretty amazing. To be able to answer a simple question immediately to a person who is blind or has low vision, is unbelievable. If you‚Äôre busy when you get a call, there‚Äôs a dozen other people waiting to answer, it‚Äôs first come, first serve, no worries."
"I used this app for the first time literally 3 minutes ago. I assisted a blind lady with choosing the correct temperature on her washer and I can‚Äôt wait to help someone else! She was so nice. This has to be the most profound, helpful app in the entire App Store. I HIGHLY recommend that you download this app and get to helping others!! I absolutely love it."
"Loved the idea but was a little nervous about my first call, thinking I might get inappropriate images. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to help someone with an activity I take for granted: making sure clothes match. It took less than 1 minute and I did it from an Uber, on my way to a commitment."
This is a great app! My friend has recently gone blind and this app along with other technology gives hope and independence to blind people. Please share this app and rate this app if your reading this and it brought you hope for your friend or loved one!! More shares more technology more hope= quality of life goes up!! Thanks
"As a sighted person, it‚Äôs great to be able to help people who are in need. The people I‚Äôve helped using this app have all been very nice, and I‚Äôm so glad to be able to lend my eyes when they‚Äôre needed. It just takes a minute or two every once in a while, and it‚Äôs amazingly helpful to the people who need it."
Be My Eyes is incredible. What an amazing concept. So far I've helped someone order something of a menu and I helped someone else find her house phone that was hidden behind her couch. Both people and calls were very heartwarming. I was so happy I could help them.
"I LOVE this app. I have only received a few calls since I started but each time makes me feel so happy, and also very thankful for things I so frequently take for granted. This is an amazing app and makes it so easy to anonymously help someone."
"I‚Äôve only gotten to answer one call, but geeze.. knowing at any moment I can help someone. This app gives me pride and joy that I am able to help others. This is so user friendly and easy to understand. Definitely recommend!"
"It feels good to help others with something we take for granted every day, our vision. 

It‚Äôs so simple to help, and one of the easiest ways to give back, thank you be my eyes for giving us the opportunity to help others through this app!"
"I‚Äôve been a volunteer since August 9th, 2019. Since then I‚Äôve had a small handful of calls. Each and every one of them left me feeling so touched that I could do something as simple as read a captcha to someone or help them pick out clothes. So happy to be a volunteer ü•∫üíó"
Awesome amazing wonderful community! I love this app so much i get excited anytime i get a notification luckily im Bilingual so i have alittle bit more of a chance to get some one. This is keeping me from going crazy in quarantine i love that i can interact with another person it can get boring in isolation lol
"My family is blind and I always like to be with them. I have certificates to help Special Needs. I am happy that this app exists. It helps them when I‚Äôm not around, since I have work and school. I also use this app, because I‚Äôm glad to help out others :)"
"I love the app and have been able to help one person so far but, I would really like to have the option to change the alert sound. The sound now is not loud enough to be heard when I‚Äôm in public. Please think about adding that option. Thanks"
"Every time I get a call, it does my heart good! So far every call I have received, the person in need is ALWAYS so sweet. 

The only downside I have found to signing up to assist the blind is that I don‚Äôt called to help someone enough. There are so many people volunteering to help the blind, that it takes a while to rotate back around to receive another call. 

This app is the favorite out of all my apps!  I actually get to help someone right then and there. It warms my heart knowing a simple answer to a question makes all the difference in the world to someone on the other end of the phone!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Every time I get to help someone through this app, it feels like I won the lottery. 

The app has just the right amount of functionality, making its operation easy in my panic to respond quickly.

I hope the developers know that they have done a very good thing for blind, low vision, and sighted society."
I‚Äôm ecstatic that I was able to help someone out in their time of need. The app was seamless and worked beautifully. The view was clear and crisp and the sound was sharp. Can‚Äôt wait for more calls to come! What a great concept for those of us who want to help others but are sometimes unsure as to how. üíû
"Through this app, I was able to help someone do something that I take for granted - sort money. That simple act made me feel so good, I smiled for days. I can‚Äôt wait for someone else to need my assistance. Thank you for creating this app. You allow people to get so much more than is given."
The idea behind this app is amazing. I can‚Äôt believe it doesn‚Äôt have more recognition. By simply taking 5 minutes out of my day I can make someone else‚Äôs life a whole lot easier. I‚Äôm so happy that I can help the blind through this app and I will continue to support this app for as long as I can!
"Magnificent app!

Now that my vision has decreased so substantially I don‚Äôt know how I would manage without apps such as this one. It is amazing to speak to a live person and get the help you need exclamation not to mention it is free and totally helpful.

Thank you so much to everybody involved in creating  and volunteering"
"While the video will occasionally lag if the caller or receiver has a bad connection, it's about what you would expect from video conferencing. I love conversing with people from around the world, and the feeling I get when I can help someone. Only downside is it doesnt ring frequently ENOUGH! :-)"
Wow! I love how we have found a way to assist people in the basic right of accessibility. This app is SO easy to use. If you can‚Äôt take the call because you are busy someone else will; and everyone I‚Äôve encountered has been so nice.
"I love being able others to help by using this app! It is a wonderful feeling, being to help others and make their lives easier just by a having a quick chat. Thank you to whoever created this app!"
"I volunteer to help people through this app. I only get calls occasionally, but every call, no matter how short or long, is meaningful. If you haven‚Äôt added this app, please do. You will be making a difference in the independence of a fellow person."
"With Covid19 keeping most of us in Illinois on lockdown for almost a year now, it‚Äôs gotten harder and harder to stay positive. This app lets me help others in an innovative way that keeps everyone safe. I am overwhelmed with happiness every single time I get a call to help someone. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I‚Äôve had a couple calls, my wife has had none. Is there a way to keep the ‚Äúmissed‚Äù notification somewhere on screen? Let us know everything's working properly."
"I got my first call today! Yes, I feel great! Yes, it‚Äôs good to give back! Yes, it took less than a minute to help someone out! She asked,‚Äù what kind of candy bar is this!‚Äù I was overjoyed to be able to provide her with such little information, yet it felt wonderful! Enjoy your candy bar."
"The thing about life is that no one can do it alone, and no one should go through life alone. So if you can help, be that person, always find the helpers in the world‚Äîalways be the helper in the world. It‚Äôll be a much better place for all if we do more for others."
I‚Äôve answered a few calls and love being able to help my fellow humans!  1 just wanted to make sure the can in the pantry was what they intended.  Another just wanted to walk through the house and ensure all lights were off.  Quick calls but so helpful and glad I can do a part!
"Download it and forget it! I haven‚Äôt yet had an opportunity to help someone through this app, but have only gotten a couple requests sent. I was driving or didn‚Äôt respond fast enough for those but there are millions of ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù so they always find someone who is available super fast."
"I am so happy to help! üòÅ I am a teacher and to be able to have friends, family and students see you guide someone is so valuable! It‚Äôs interesting to see what hurdles low or no vision people face on a daily basis. I have a friend who is slowly losing his vision, I love knowing he can have the support of Be My Eyes when he needs it."
"After I got sick with cancer and had an immediate life change I knew I wanted to do anything big or small to help other people. 
I came across this app and immediately knew it was for me. 
I‚Äôve only probably had about 10 calls overall in the past 2 years I have been a volunteer, but every time it‚Äôs been a warm, honest experience. 
I love to help. I love to feel connected and know that I helped one person that day. 
Brilliant app. Wonderful people on both ends. 
Im proud to be a part of this and continue to do so indefinitely. 

Marielle"
"So far I‚Äôve gotten 4 calls in the last 2 years. The calls aren‚Äôt very often because there are so many more volunteers than people to seek the help, but when every call was worth the wait. It feels so nice to help give back."
"This app is super easy to use and a great way to help others from wherever you are. There are a ton of volunteers on the app so it‚Äôs not very often that I get the pleasure of answering a call, but when I do get one it‚Äôs very rewarding! Thank you for creating such a useful app."
I just got my first call after having this app for a month. I got to help someone turn their air on because it was stuck on the heat. He was so grateful & the feeling of being able to help someone with such a small gesture is addictive. I wish I could answer calls all day lol!!
I have helped people pick out to for everything from pants for a date to find the right soup for dinner. I‚Äôve helped people read mail and understand things. This is an amazing app! It only takes a couple minutes to help someone. You should download it too!
But I would love to help someone but the few times I'll get the notification that someone needs help by the time I open my phone (like 3 seconds after getting the notification) someone else has already answered the call. I wish I could get the chance to help. Maybe give the volunteer at least 5-8 seconds to answer??
"I love this app! Awesome concept. As a doctoral student I have little time to volunteer in the traditional sense, this app makes it possible to serve in a meaningful and convenient way. I actually get excited when a call comes in! It's been a pleasure to connect with/help folks from around the globe. I encourage you to join the fun!"
It‚Äôs a win win. The person calling you gets much needed help and you feel a whole lot better when you do. It was a very nice feeling starting my day helping someone and it‚Äôs easy! I come from a customer service background and it was a very natural flowing conversation.
"I love this app! It gives you the opportunity of stopping your everyday routine to help someone in need. And takes you out of your element and reminds you to not take the things we have for granted. When you help someone, you instantly feel overjoyed, I love it and I know you will too!"
"Im always moved by good works, with humanity and affection. I've helped ( i cant call it help tbh, its the least that we could do ) many blind people, I've had different experiences and stories, and I've never been more thankful for being in contact with them. Being able to do something good. God bless you üíï"
"I‚Äôve only gotten 1 call so far, but wow! It feels amazing to be able to help someone. To be able to help someone you don‚Äôt know and to be able to make such an impact in a stranger‚Äôs life. Even by doing the simplest of things like reading a bill, a card, or helping pick out clothes. Such a blessing to be a blessing."
"The app is SO easy to use. When I get a notification for a call, I jump at the chance to answer. It‚Äôs so nice to be about to help and is a great expansion of your knowledge of how individuals cope with being sightless. Everyone that I‚Äôve answered a call for has been so nice and appreciative."
"Two strangers that shared a moment of love, helpfulness and kindness. Hoped for eachother the best and went their separate ways. This just made my whole day‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you so much for this app. It doesn‚Äôt only help the visually impaired, but also the in need for a selfless moment."
"This is absolutely amazing! I love helping any way I can so when I heard of this app I was so excited to be a part of it, I can‚Äôt wait to receive my first call! They give instructions with pre recorded calls to try before a real call too and it‚Äôs all so easy"
"So i saw this on IG, and i thought it would be awesome if i could help. I know several people who are visually impaired, and this app and community is making their day to day lives easier, and they are allowing others to help. I absolutely love the app and how easy it has made it for everyone to get involved"
"Although calls are few and far between, it‚Äôs great to see an app that has millions able to assist the low vision and blind people of the world! When calls come, I know that if I can‚Äôt answer it immediately, there are thousands the receive the same alert."
"I have only been able to answer a few calls since I have had this application, but feel blessed to be able to help. I like the way that the application lets the blind person use their cellphone camera to show me what they need help understanding and how it enables us to talk."
"There is nothing better than being able to meet someone and help them out at the same time. I was beyond excited, I honestly felt like a child throughout the whole call. I absolutely love what this app does and I think this is the best app out there, I cannot wait for my next call ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I took my first call today. I helped a woman decipher which seasoning packet was for meatloaf and which was beef stew. When we hung up I felt overjoyed that I was able to assist someone else so much so effortlessly. I about cried it made me feel that good. 
10/10."
"I will never not have this app on my phone. The camera quality is great, audio quality is also great. Given your WiFi or LTE service. It‚Äôs a great feeling to help others, and I recommend this app whenever the conversation arises."
"I love this alp and I feel so good after each call!
The ONLY thing I would change is the ringer. I cannot adjust the volume or tone and it‚Äôs barely audible unless the phone is in my hand. Wish I could adjust."
"I signed up to be a volunteer to help those who are visually impaired. I have helped others with color clothing choices, canned food ingredients and reading a receipt for bookkeeping purposes. I love love this. I love helping and I‚Äôm so glad this is available for those who need it."
"i‚Äôve always had a passion for helping people. this app allows me to do for others what they can‚Äôt do for themselves. i had the sweetest interaction earlier today, actually. a young boy reached out and i accepted his call. he was trying to differentiate between essential oils. at the end of the call, he thanked me, and said ‚Äúi love you‚Äù. it was the sweetest thing, coming from such a young child. of course i told him i loved him as well :) the smallest things mean the most to them‚ù§Ô∏èchildren make my heart happy. i love helping others, young and old. best app on the store, 10/10 recommended."
"I signed up over a year ago and have patiently waited for my call to help. I finally got one today, and my heart feels so big. I am reminded to appreciate the easy and little things in life we often take for granted. Such a humbling and feel good experience. I love this and i can‚Äôt wait for my next call."
"Answering calls for folks on this app is so easy and so rewarding! Providing assistance that is so easy as a sighted person gives me an incredible feeling every single time.

A true demonstration of the power of technology to help people and connect us with each other in meaningful ways."
"There are so many apps that can help you do just about anything, but this app allows you to help someone else that without it can be challenged doing the things we take for grated.  Get this app, and you will feel good for helping others by simply being the eyes for them."
"If you are blind, this app will give you access to people who love helping. You no longer have to worry about asking the same people for help over and over. 

If you are sighted, getting a call and helping someone will brighten your day and satisfy the deep desire to be of value to others."
"I downloaded the app a few months ago. I got my first call a few weeks ago helping a woman read her insurance card while she was sitting at a diner eating breakfast! How cool is that? A simple iPhone app just changed the game for the visually impaired. Whoever thought this up, good job!"
"My only problem is that it often takes too long to open the app to answer, and the call rolls to the next person. I'm hoping the latest version solves this, in which case I will up my rating to 5 stars. 
One of the calls I received was from a woman who said it changed her life by giving her more independence."
"Easy to use and provides a real service. I‚Äôve had it for a few years now and only had a couple of calls, but it seems to work perfectly as intended."
To be able to help someone in any kind of way makes me the happiest. Something as simple as helping someone pick the right color clothing makes my day. This app is the most amazing thing someone could have come up with ü•∞
I have had the app a little over a month now and finally got my first call! I got to help the sweetest man named Larry find a steak in his freezer! He was appreciative and I couldn‚Äôt help but tear up knowing I was able to help him. So happy I got this app!
So glad that there are so many volunteers! I don‚Äôt get many calls but I have gotten a handful and just answering questions of what color something is to a phone number makes my heart feel so much happier.
"Such a small thing for me to take a minute out of my day to answer a call from a blind person. you are helping someone with something that seems trivial to us but bc they‚Äôre blind, they need the help. If i miss a call, i feel solace to know someone else had gotten it."
I was very impressed with the Be My Eyes application specialized help section. I called the Microsoft disability answer desk and was able to have them reset the Microsoft store to get my applications to download properly. Definitely impressed with Be My Eyes in general. So grateful to the developer who made this application possible.
"I love to see technology being used for good. Be My Eyes is a perfect example! 

About 1x a month I get a Be My Eyes request. It‚Äôs a simple problem for me to answer‚ÄîIs this a $10 bill? Is this my new Medicare card? What is the setting on xyz? The question takes less than 45 seconds. How easy! 

I also love that we‚Äôre freeing up family members/ care givers. If you‚Äôve ever been a caregiver for a few hours or years, you know that any trusted help is appreciated. 

I‚Äôm so happy to be a part of Be My Eyes. Tell your friends/ family to join if they need help or to volunteer."
Download it now! The only excuse you can have is if you‚Äôre never on your phone. IF you‚Äôre always on your phone (which many of us are) it‚Äôs super easy to use and can help someone during a quick little painless video call. Spread it like wildfire.
I‚Äôm a volunteer and I had to wait over a year until I could finally help someone today for the first time. However it makes me happy to know there are so many people on call to help. This app is amazing and I‚Äôm happy to be a volunteer
Just being able to help someone out in their day makes my day.  I love this app and I recommend it to anyone that has a kind heart and wants to help people just because.   I‚Äôve recommend it to everyone I know
I just received my first call and it only took one day!! It was a lady asking the color of a shirt. We were both excited she was my first call! I can‚Äôt wait to get more calls. This app is amazing. Whoever thought of this deserves an award.
"I got my first call today, a male that had just shaved and wanted to make sure he was even on both sides, he was so nice and appreciative for the help! This is the most awesome app ever! I am a 911 dispatcher so I help people daily, it‚Äôs nice to be able to help visually impaired people when I can!"
"I‚Äôve been a volunteer since 2015 and taken several calls.  They‚Äôve all been unique, fun and simple.  It‚Äôs a great opportunity to easily help someone and it feels good to do it.
Human connection is important and I hope they‚Äôd do the same for me if I needed a bit of help."
I‚Äôve been a helper on this app for the past year (at least) and every single experience I‚Äôve had helping those who need it has been stellar. I love having the opportunity to help another person and this app always leaves me feeling happy and good.
I have only used this service 3 times and every time it has been awesome. I was trying to get my computer to speak and a BME volunteer was able to talk me through it. I have also used it to identify a bottle of wine and while in a store to identify and select snacks. Thanks bunches to all of the volunteers!
It really makes my day when I can help someone in need with just a simple app. I like the functionality of being able to use their flashlight on the other phone and of course the camera. Haven‚Äôt had any technical issues.
"When I got my first call I was so nervous but I answered and there was a nice older lady just wanting help finding the right can of beans to cook. Everything was so easy and effortless-definitely was overthinking it. 
I cannot wait to be selected again to help! 
‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
This is one of those apps that just touches my heart and seems so unreal. But you guys definitely have put this platform together very well! Just wish I was able to help more people more frequently!!
"My only complaint is not getting enough calls. ü•∞
I'm so excited about being a helper! I did receive one call and it was so great. I love the idea of an app created with the sole purpose of helping a person at a time. It restores my faith in humanity."
This innovative app works well when someone needs assistance with visual tasks. I love the incorporation of the flashlight/torch as it allows the assistant to provide extra light when they seen it necessary. Wonderfully done! I highly recommend this app.
"I answered my first call last night. I was so nervous. It wasn‚Äôt as easy due to the left and right and the camera, but we did it! The feeling of helping someone in need made my day. I highly recommend everyone to volunteer."
This app is so amazing. I love helping people who can‚Äôt see. Technology is very important now and days so why not make it useful. Hearing how people reply when I help them warms my heart. I will definitely keep this app on any device I come in contact with.
I got my first call today. Unfortunately what he was looking at was a schematic that I didn‚Äôt understand. I hope he was able to find someone who could help him. He was very kind and thanked me for trying to help. Wonderful App!!
"I love the idea of the app and I genuinely appreciate everybody who is able to help but I joined about 3 months ago and was excited to get my first call. And I never did and still haven‚Äôt I realized that their are almost 20x as many helpers as there are blind or in need of help, I take that into consideration as well. I just read a review that said he didn‚Äôt get a call for a year and a half. Someone fix the system"
I get a call once every couple months and I‚Äôve only been lucky enough once to answer it. It was such a small thing but it helped out in the ways strangers might not usually want to help out. I definitely recommend it to everyone!
"Dear all ( Be my Eye developers )

Would like to have a point scale how we helped or not so you can encourage us to do more .

More to add there are some scams account one of them asked me for money ) and had sent a report about it but never heard back , by this bad guys can control the app thanks"
"Such an easy app to use and what an amazing service that it provides to others! I signed up on a Monday and received my first call on a Tuesday. Very simple tutorials to follow, preparing you for your first call. So easy to answer your calls when they come through. Very intuitive!"
"I downloaded the app 2 days ago, and the very next day I received a call. I was able to help someone from my pantry while my son was at school. How amazing it is to be able to help someone across the States from my house in my time off? Such an amazing idea and concept."
"What a great app!
Helping others is set up in such a way that it never imposes itself in your life.   If you are busy many volunteers are ready help.   
I wish Apple would do more promotions of your app and services.   
Keep up the great work!"
I really love this app because it allows me to help others. I typically only get a call about once every 3 to 4 months and it can be as easy as asking me what color a jacket is or the color of a suit. #PayItForward #LoveAll #LoveTheNeighbor
I think this app is an amazing way we can help the blind. I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it is especially if it happens quick and unexpectedly. I‚Äôm so glad we can help make life a little easier all bc someone so selflessly made this app! You rock!
"Just had my first call this morning and I was able to help a blind man find an item in his pantry. 
Talk about thrilling!!! I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to see for someone who cannot. 
Very small, but nonetheless a great experience. 
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
I just received my first call from someone in Ireland that needed help reading something. I have the feeling he not only needed help but was lonely. I spoke to this kind soul for a minute or two and am very thankful that I was able to help.
"Wish there were more people to help. This app gives me all the feels when I answer the call. One missed call but was able to assist two people so far, about 6 months apart. Love this app and wish I could help more! 
Kindly,"
I‚Äôve been an ‚ÄúAnswerer?‚Äù for Be My Eyes since it launched & I still enjoy getting a call & being able to help somebody real quick. Can of peas? Red shirt? Do these shoes match? Use your sight to help someone else. It‚Äôll make both of your days better. üåû
There are few things that bring me as much joy as being the one who gets to answer a call for a friend on Be My Eyes. I‚Äôm constantly bowled over by the kindness and grace of the people I meet on this app. What an amazing gift to be able to be a part of this community.
I‚Äôve been blind for five years now and I‚Äôve been using this app for little over two years. I‚Äôve had nothing but great experiences. Met some great people from all over the world. I highly recommend this app for people who are blind to get any help around the house or wherever. Great app.
"While my first call went on (after I was asked permission) for ten minutes or so, most calls are quick, simple, and easily answered.  Just remember you can ask to have the light turned on or the camera tilted!"
I am impressed at the seamless experience of this app. It provides a much needed service and allows it in a private and quick manner for users. I really enjoy getting a call and seeing how many people are volunteering!
"I have been using this app since 2019 and love answering the calls. If I miss a call, I‚Äôm disappointed- everyone I have been able to help has been so kind, and it was a boost in my day to be able to help a strap."
"A friend mentioned this company, and it resonated with me. I have taken numerous calls and I'm always humbled and grateful to help. To think that a few minutes of my day can mean the world to someone else...worth every minute to be a volunteer. Genius company and app."
"Great opportunity to volunteer, flexible, and important. Could really help or impact someone‚Äôs day or life with a simple call response.  Simple and efficient way for those that would like to volunteer to engage- even during a pandemic for example"
What a blessing this app is to those both in need and the volunteers. To be their eyes if only for a few moments brings back your faith in humanity and makes your heart full I promise you.
It was an older woman I believe she was blind she needed me to tell her how many whistles were in the party pack and what colors it felt amazing to be able to help someone else from somewhere else around the world‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüíû
"I really love this app. Just doing the bare minimum, by simply helping find something, or read something, you can make someone‚Äôs day. This app is a great volunteer experience. It gives me so much joy that I can help and I‚Äôm just grateful for this opportunity."
"I only helped one person so far, and it happened to be on my birthday. It was the most amazing experience and I think it‚Äôs great that we can use technology to make people‚Äôs lives easier."
"The app is simple, clean and intuitive. Many apps today are cluttered with information and conflicting calls to action. The creators of Be My Eyes know what they‚Äôre solving and focus on it ‚Äî providing contextual, sighted assistance to the visually impaired on-demand. They do a great job."
"Compassion at it‚Äôs best. Apart from the help for the blind. To this day I haven‚Äôt been consciously grateful for something, until used for others is overwhelmingly humbling, resulting in real and instant happiness & gratification. The app works great. If anything I wish To be utilized more often."
"I believe as humans deep down we all want to help each other, and be connected. I am so thankful for this app and for all those who use it! I just got my first call to assist today, and it was so easy to use and help. Everyone should have this installed on their phone!"
"This app seems like it is really revolutionary and helpful. As someone wanting to help, I would love to do this, but I wish there was an ability to schedule my available times. Getting a call while in the car, or at work isn‚Äôt great. It would be much better if I could set my availability for when I‚Äôm at home doing nothing."
"After using Be My Eyes for a couple of years now, I have to say this is a prime example of technology being used for good. It feels incredible to help someone with a task so simple yet challenging for them to do on their own. I look forward to incoming calls from Be My Eyes every day!"
This app allows you to help those who really need your help. Download and even though it might take weeks for someone in need to call at least you know you can and will help them!
"Just simply amazing. I‚Äôve gotten one call so far , and I‚Äôve missed a couple now and it makes me so sad when I don‚Äôt get it in time!! I really hope I continue to get calls and can get another one very soon!"
"I‚Äôve helped lots of older folks with poor or no vision with little things around their home, like reading the labels on cleaning products so they know which one to use. 10/10 interactions with some sweet people. It‚Äôs a privilege to help."
"Nothing better than being able to help someone in the spot, when they need it.  It‚Äôs my favorite calls to receive and wish I got more!"
"I got to answer my first call yesterday and it‚Äôs really heart filling! Although I‚Äôm only slightly visually  impaired & not blind, I really enjoy sharing my vision. It‚Äôs really a sweet feeling when you know you actually helped someone and it‚Äôs so humbling  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This app changes lives. Not only does it help give blind people the opportunity to see without feeling like a burden, it gives others a chance to feel helpful and together there‚Äôs a special connection the world needs."
If only I had more time to connect with this sweet woman.  She called in the middle of a busy work day and asked me to describe the colors and pattern of her dress.  Then we got to go into her closet and pick out shoes.  It was such fun! I know she will look beautiful in her silver flats :). Loved everything about the experience.
Idk if it‚Äôs good yet bc I‚Äôm downloading it rn qnd Troye recommends it so it must be good. Plus I just think that this is an amazing and useful idea in general so even if the app has some issues when I use it I know that there is at least someone out there that can be helped through this app.
Thank you for creating a place where people can connect to help one another. I wish I would have found the app when it first started.. I find myself patiently waiting for the next time a request is sent.
What a wonderful concept. Very easy to download the app and get set up. I had my first call and wow how amazing it was that I could be of service to someone in another state/ time zone. I would definitely recommend my friends and family to sign up and be of service.
"I‚Äôve now gotten to help 3 people with things like ‚ÄúWhat Color is the button glowing?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is the Up arrow on the keyboard?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI got turned around and am lost can you tell me if the railing is behind me or in front of me?‚Äù 

Very thankful I can help someone in need, somewhere in the world!!"
I am a seer on the app. The app allows folks to get help with sight-assisted activities. I love receiving these calls. I hope this platform is helping everyone achieve independence and a helping hand. Thanks to the creators fr making this and bringing more accessibility to the world.
"I had the opportunity to be contacted and assist with vitamin identification, and settings on the washing machine.  
We had a very nice conversation about family histories and even shared our love of cultural foods!   A great experience and looking forward to assisting again!"
"I am so happy to be a volunteer with
 ‚ÄúBe my eyes‚Äù
It is a joy to answer the phone and be of assistance. It is an easy app to use and I believe those requesting assistance are finding it helpful as well. I want to thank the creators and all participants. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
You don‚Äôt realize the minute you get the call who‚Äôs gonna change the day you or the caller. I have cried after hanging up so many times. From the LOVE that is truly shared with each call!  I wish they‚Äôd call more!!! üíïüíØ
"I am a volunteer in this app.  I find this app very good and I am very happy to help people. But there is a small problem that the video chat is a bit blurry, making it difficult for me and other volunteers to see the items/things. Hope you can fix. Thanks"
I recently helped a blind couple find where to spray for ants they were having a problem with. It genuinely made my day to be of service to them... what an ingenious way to help! Thank you for providing such a platform to do so.
Got the app and waited for a while and I got my first call. I helped someone turn on the ac since it was hot in their house and they felt dizzy. Felt great. Easy call and was glad and humbled to be able to help want your own story? Volunteer today!
This app has purpose and  is gives you an opportunity to be of service to others when they need it most!
"Cool app, got my first call a few weeks ago, the man just wanted me to read off his lotto ticket numbers. He couldn‚Äôt hear well but he was able to eventually hear me read his number. Quality is a little grainy but it was a wholesome experience"
This app is so cool to me that anyone anywhere can help anyone somewhere else through their phone. I‚Äôve answered 2 calls now and it the most exciting thing. It brightened my day more than anyone else‚Äôs and I highly recommend this app.
"I downloaded this app last spring. Tonight was the first time I was connected with someone who needed my eyes (They alert several volunteers, and the first to answer gets connected)! I love being able to help a stranger, and think this is a lovely way to do that."
"We desperately need more apps of this nature/category than we do of any others. No matter your politics, no one should fall through the cracks of this too often difficult world."
I downloaded this app after seeing a video about it on Facebook. I got my first call the day after and was able to help someone choose a tie that matched their jacket. Such an awesome experience and very easy to use the app! I have recommended it to a bunch of people!
"I signed up as a volunteer and my first exchange with a blind user made me so happy. It feels so good to do something for someone else that only takes a couple moments. It‚Äôs so easy to do, they hear your voice and you see through their camera. 100% recommend."
"I, as a blind user, was hooked from the word go! Another IOS user had shown me how this worked, and I didn‚Äôt have an IOS device yet. Once I did, this was one of the first apps I installed! For sighted individuals, you would love volunteering for this, and for blind users, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
"I‚Äôve been using this app for over a year and every time I get a call I get very excited, people are so nice and it is a great way to help while being in your home."
"Amazing use of technology, just such a good idea that is so easy to use, it takes under a minute to answer a call usually but you could be making someone‚Äôs day! 
Highly recommend"
Makes you realize how the small things are important. Humbles you real quick! Love being able to help. I shared with family and friends. This concept is amazing
"What a wonderful app!! Even though there are way more people to help than there are people who NEED help, I‚Äôve gotten 2 calls in the past year! It‚Äôs rewarding to be able to help someone complete a task that sighted people take for granted. I LOVE this app."
