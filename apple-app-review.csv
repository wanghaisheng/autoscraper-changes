"The app has been working great! As for the purpose of the app, I can‚Äôt think of a better (and easier) way to help others in my spare time than to guide them when needed. Calls cover every aspect of daily struggles some vision impaired people face; which one is the shampoo or conditioner? Is this a red shirt? Or how about: Which tube is toothpaste and which one ointment (both smell minty!) My wife also supports my participation by doing things to help me have a good interaction - such as turning the sound off the TV if we happen to be watching when a call comes in... we high-five when a call goes well and I‚Äôve helped some one out. Please download the app and give it a try. You don‚Äôt have to answer every call - but when you do, the rewarding experience of helping a stranger by simply describing what you see (for them) is golden. And if you need help ... get the app and call me... I‚Äôll be here waiting to help! PS I think it‚Äôs important to note this is a ‚Äúhelper‚Äù app and not a venue for social connections. I keep my interactions very professional as to not impose myself when all the caller wants is a quick hand without feeling like they have to spend more time than necessary on the app. It‚Äôs a tool for them so respect that. Of course sometimes conversations happen - that‚Äôs OK, but let it be on the recipients terms, not yours."
"I am a volunteer I signed up 2 days ago and got my first call earlier today!!! I was playing with my phone when all of a sudden this weird ringtone came on I looked down and was shocked and super excited at the same time! After talking to some friends that have it and reading the reviews I didn‚Äôt expect to get a call for a while so I was super shocked I was getting my first call already üòä. It was as amazing as I expected, didn‚Äôt take much time at all I helped a gentleman with his computer and logging on (letting him know what was on his laptop screen and when it turned on) easy peasy.. I was so grateful to be able to be there for him and thankful for an app like this one! Seriously this app is amazing and have told everyone I know about it! My soon to be 18 he old daughter now has it on her phone as well üòä There is no better feeling you get when you know that you‚Äôre helping people. For me it really put the little things into perspective... Just how much I take them granted.. ok ok  I could go on I love it so much lol so I‚Äôll end with this absolutely love this app, works like a charm so far, you guys are amazing for making this and I‚Äôm truly grateful to be part of it!"
"I love answering calls because it humbles me that low vision or blind people go through a lot of extra work just to get through daily life. And to be able to make it easier for them means the world to me. It ALWAYS makes me smile even if I‚Äôm having a bad day by helping. Everyone is so grateful and wonderful to work with. I even helped out a man with narrowed vision who voluntarily goes out and helps homeless people and needed help reading a SUPER small print sheet that had all the resources for people in need. He just needed to find the one for housing to help people get back on their feet. Not only are they giving back and volunteering, but I felt a part of it at the same time because I was able to help him find the resources he needed so he could give out to those he helps who are homeless. Someone with a disability giving back in the way they receive help themselves is the definition of giving forward. And I just think this is Suh an amazing app, with amazing people all over the world. I can‚Äôt want until my next call to help out someone new. Now if I could also meet them, that would just mean the world to me to meet these incredible people. They inspire me."
"This App really makes it easy to be the eyes for someone with low vision or even blindness.  You answer a special ring tone if you have time (usually about 10 mins or so) if not someone else probably can get it.  I always try to make time when I can.  The callers need help with rather simple tasks and they know what they need but not being able to see is their only obstacle.  With CoVid 19 isolating low sighted and blind persons from their normal support group of sighted friends and family has left them in a lurch.  Once it was helping a lady find the right bills to pay for grocery delivery,  once helping a lady read her prescription number to a pharmacist over the phone, helping someone who needed to match an outfit for a job interview (not used to wearing business clothes) and helping with computer issues.  Nothing has been too hard or too time consuming and the feeling of being able to help someone pick the right train track can be a godsend to the person on the other end.  Reminds me not to take my sight for granted. The callers are very respectful of your time and truly appreciate the help."
"I love having this app on my phone. While I have only received two calls in the last 6 months (I was too late to answer my first call, but successfully answered the second call today!), it‚Äôs still amazing that I was able to help someone with something so small; something the rest of us take for granted every day. 

Today a woman called asking if I could help her adjust her thermostat. When she pointed the camera, it was a little low. I asked her to hold the phone up a little, and then I was able to see the thermostat clearly. Her heat was set on 70¬∞, so she counted the buttons up to 75¬∞ and I let her know she had successfully turned her heat up. She said she didn‚Äôt need anymore help and thanked me for helping! I told her she was welcome and to have a great day. She was very sweet and I was glad I got to help:) 

A lot of these reviews seem to forget this app is for the visually impaired. It isn‚Äôt about how many calls you get to answer, or how great you feel because you volunteered. This app is designed to help those who need it. I think it‚Äôs wonderful that so many people volunteer, regardless of the number of people that need help."
I think many people enjoy helping so it‚Äôs a good way to help.  I‚Äôve had maybe 5 calls in 2 years but only able to answer one of them fast enough and it was a person paying for a taxi verifying the correct payment amount.  You probably will only get a few calls and maybe be lucky enough to answer one or two because there‚Äôs WAY more volunteers than users but it seems like a great service for those with visual impairments.  If you have an iPhone you need to make sure it doesn‚Äôt offload the app to the cloud because you may only get a call like every few months so if you don‚Äôt use it iPhone will offload it to the cloud and you won‚Äôt get notifications when you have a call.  This is probably a comment for another forum but in general ‚ÄúApple‚Äù needs to make an iOS fix to allow the user to designate certain apps (any app) to not ever go to the cloud due to inactivity.  Seems like this is kind of an obvious missing feature from the iPhone settings ‚ÄúApple‚Äù‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt you go ahead and fix that for all of us mmmkay?
"I downloaded this app about 2 years ago. I did it the first second I learned of it. I jumped at the chance to answer a call every time I saw my phone ringing, but I was never quite quick enough! Which goes to show you how many great Americans are out there who want to help just as much as I do! Finally though it happened... My phone rang and I clicked to answer and I actually started to be connected with the caller! She wanted something as simple as me telling her which bag of candy was which because she had about 5 bags of miniature candy. That was it. The overwhelming joy that my heart felt to be able to help someone who‚Äôs incapable of doing such small tasks such as that, overjoys  me. After the call I just was stuck sitting there for a moment with a smile on my face, and almost sad that I couldn‚Äôt help her with more. I hope others can join this app too and have the chance to answer a call to feel the happiness I felt. God bless whomever came up with this app and I hope to be able to continue to help those who cannot help themselves."
"I recently read about someone who had troubles getting help because nobody answered. Well, I always try to answer, but I have to unlock my phone first. By the time I get it unlocked, the call has been passed to someone else. If I have more than a few seconds to answer, I would be able to answer more often. It would be great if the request came through as a FaceTime call; I think I don‚Äôt have to unlock my phone for that. Furthermore, I would be more useful if I could set my app to available or unavailable when I‚Äôm sitting idle or driving. Because of the issues I have answering and the rarity of requests, I have often considered deleting the app altogether. 
 Other than my two complaints, I have enjoyed the app. I really enjoyed helping the two folks I was able to assist. I‚Äôll be honest, I get really excited when the opportunity to help someone arises. Helping others is what I enjoy most in life, but I would like more opportunities to do so. Thank you to the creators of Be My Eyes for creating something so wonderful. I don‚Äôt expect it to be perfect, but I hope my feedback helps improve the experience for everyone."
"I love being able to help someone day or night 24/7. There is many people who are willing to answer the call whenever you need help. I just have one wish that the assistant could have settings where we can make our calls louder and call whenever we want not just where we live, instead of the original of what comes with the app. I am half deaf so I can barely hear when someone calls, but I have my volume up the highest it can go, and I have my settings on the loudest it can do on my part on my phone. I wish the app would fix or put in settings where you can choose a louder sound for calls. I would love to help more people if the app can put better features that can happen so I can get to my phone faster. Lol I just love helping people!  But other than that I am very happy to be able to help the visually impaired and I hope more visually impaired people will use this app for help there are so many volunteers there is always someone there 24/7 to help you in any country!"
"I just had my first call with an absolutely lovely young lady who needed help with her thermostat and reading the instructions on a food item she wanted to heat. I was honestly just so happy to have finally received a call and I hope that I was thorough in helping her. She was so sweet and fun to talk to as well, which is just an added bonus!

I wish I had remembered the ‚Äòscreen shot‚Äô feature sooner in the call (ahh!) because it is a total game changer. Hopefully I have a second call now that I‚Äôm familiar with the platform.

So, New volunteers, here are a few tips if you‚Äôre feeling unsure:
-  dont forget the ‚Äòscreenshot‚Äô, ‚Äòtorch‚Äô and being able to background the app (useful to look something up via the browser on your phone during the call if needed) 
- Make sure that after you both complete the task(s) at hand, you ask again if they need help with anything else (possibly a continuation of what the call was about i.e. I wish I would have asked if she needed help with actually preparing the food item after I read her the heating instructions for it, without overstepping).    

The interface of Be My Eyes is next level, top notch, A grade‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs an understatement.

In closing, this short interaction did just as much for me (if not more) than it did for her. Thank you for giving me the chance to make someone‚Äôs life a little easier (I hope! üòÑ). 

Best App, ever. <3"
"I have been a member about 6 months. I was the first to answer a call for the first time about a month ago. That gentleman was new to the app and just wanted to try it out and ask some questions. Today I received a call where a woman had three pairs of tights, and needed to know which were blue, brown, and black. It was easy to help her and she seemed very grateful. 

As someone with RP but who still has very functional vision, it is so rewarding to be able to offer assistance. I have seen negative reviews from others that were frustrated they rarely got calls, and were never the first to answer. It was five months before I was actually able to help someone, so just stick with it. I think it is also helpful to remember this isn't about you, it's about the person that needs assistance. Basically you have nothing to lose by being a member, and eventually will be able to assist someone. I am glad there are services like this out there for me when I need help someday."
"I‚Äôve been involved with this project for a year or so now and I‚Äôm still just as happy with the app as when I started. Since the purpose of the app is to connect someone with a question to someone who can give a visual response, I have no suggestions on how to improve it. It does exactly that. 

I think it might be helpful to be told how to respond answering the call though. The callers are always nice, but not looking for friends or conversations. Just answers to their momentary dilemma. I answer: ‚ÄúHi, this is Helen. How can I assist you today?‚Äù  It‚Äôs short, friendly and informative. The caller doesn‚Äôt always give their name and usually go straight to their question. 

My calls so far are: do these slacks match this blouse? I have 2 pieces of mail; who are they from? How much is this bill for? I‚Äôm in a meeting and don‚Äôt know what the error message is on my screen. And the like. 

I have missed a few calls because I didn‚Äôt answer the phone quickly enough and my disappointment was always real. I‚Äôm glad the service moves quickly through phone contacts to better help the caller, but disappointed that the helper wasn‚Äôt me. If I did nothing else that day, I knew I gave someone real help and the sense of pride and satisfaction is terrific! 

Long review, but aside from wishing I received more calls, I can‚Äôt recommend this app or service enough! It‚Äôs 5 star across the board!"
"I love having this app on my phone and think it‚Äôs a great way to help! I am always willing to help whoever calls with whatever it is they need as my sight is something I often forget about being a blessing to have and to think how scary it must be to not have sight makes me want to ease that fear, even if just a little! The apps like these!, the ones that truly make things better for others, are not often found and it would be such a better place if we were able to ha e more apps like theses as it can serve as a reminder to be grateful for what we do have and to remember that when we think it‚Äôs the worse it actually is worse for others and it can put a little nudge in your ear that says, ‚Äúseriously?‚Äù Here I am complaining about this when there‚Äôs people that will never know what the sky looks like, or the color of rain! It‚Äôs very humbling and rewarding all at the same time! Thanks for this reminder and opportunity!"
"I can‚Äôt believe how many self entitled reviewers are giving this app a negative review because they ‚Äúweren‚Äôt given enough time to answer‚Äù or never get to answer calls as if this is some game they‚Äôre not being picked to play in. If Someone else gets there faster than you, then that means someone who needed help got it quicker and that‚Äôs never a bad thing and it means the app is working as intended‚Ä¶ with as little wait time as possible for the blind/visually impaired. This app works for those who need it and not for those who want to pat themselves on the back. I‚Äôve had 3 interactions in 3 years and many calls where I wasn‚Äôt the one to be connected. If you really want to be available to help then it‚Äôs worth it to keep the app on your phone for that one time where maybe not many people are in a position to answer the call, but you are."
"I have had the opportunity to answer a call twice. The first time I was helping a gentleman with a clock. I caught myself saying ‚Äú.do you see this button‚Äù and of course quickly realize how dumb I sounded and needed to find other ways to describe like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a button on the left of it, try to feel for it‚Ä¶‚Äù. He was very appreciative and didn‚Äôt seem frustrated by my ‚Äúdo you see‚Äù comments. The second time was a woman going out for the evening and had some top laid out on the bed to match her pants.   This time I was sure to be careful with my choice of words. We had a lovely chat and I helped her pick her outfit.  Both times only took maybe 10 minutes and I‚Äôm sure I got more out of it then the folks I helped did. Both times when I hung up, I gave thanks for the health of my eyes, something most of us take for granted daily. Way to go Be My Eyes!

"I am a sighted person who receives calls from blind people seeking help, and I cannot express how it fills my heart to know that even on days that I stay in my pajamas, I can be of service to another person. Even something as small (to me) as indicating the color of socks laid out in front of my screen, clearly makes an impact on the person calling. I‚Äôve talked to lovely people and encourage more people who are no and multilingual to join. There are many times over the volunteers versus the blind, but I imagine not a huge amount with that skillset. I‚Äôd highly recommend this app, either way. It truly does make a difference for both parties and I am grateful to have been able to partake in it. Such an intelligent and awesome way to solve a problem that lifts the burden off someone who may otherwise have to seek out family or friends who aren‚Äôt right there with them."
"Update after three years continuous use as a sighted helper:  the app has come a long way in development (wasn‚Äôt horrible at the beginning though) and is now very solid and refined.  Excellent software and network.

With 0.8 million sighted folks on the net at this writing expect anytime/all the time assistance if you are blind / VI, and an incoming call every few months if you are sighted.

Give it a try without hesitation.

‚Äî‚Äî-(original review)‚Äî‚Äî-

Been a sighted helper on the net for a couple years.  Current version has decent connection stability, very easy to take a call and render assistance when needed.  If I‚Äôm unavailable (driving, busy, etc.) the notification is distinct but NOT invasive, and it clears quickly without intervention.  Nearby folks will notice it but it‚Äôs unlikely you get harsh reactions if a call comes in at a bad time.

Due to the huge sighted : blind ratio of users on the net, incoming assist calls will be very infrequent.  If you get 10 a year, consider yourself lucky unless you sign up as fluent in multiple languages.

As a sighted helper, It‚Äôs EASY to do, FUN to help folks, and takes virtually ZERO time and effort.  As a blind user, know that there‚Äôs an army of ‚Äúlight dependent‚Äù folks eager and excited to lend a hand anytime and as often as you like.

This a great network.  One of the best applications of smartphone tech I‚Äôve encountered.  Grab a copy and join in."
"I saw the ad on somewhere. I looked on App Store and said I need to get this right now. First call I helped the woman choose clothes. It really puts a huge smile on my face for a easy and caring thing that a lot of humans can do. I got a few more calls. I love it!! You get to help people no trouble. I myself is disabled. I have a prosthetic leg. If it was switched I would really be thanking the creators and volunteers for simple kindness. I‚Äôm disabled, but not enough to not help someone else disabled or not disabled. This is one of my favourite apps. Also you can be rated. Don‚Äôt worry getting bad volunteers because than they could not get calls when you rate badly. One thing that is a less joy and more of a curse is the numbers of volunteers. The number grow everyday and so I get less calls. But every call. I smile so big. Thank you creators. This is one of my favourite apps."
"Isn‚Äôt it amazing to be able to see what color socks you will put on in the morning? They are some people that don‚Äôt have that luxury, we as a human race know how to share with one another. The ability to help one another is embedded in all of us. The kindest gesture to help a person in need, is to be able to give them your time. Just a few moments to ease the persons mind in this time of struggle. I don‚Äôt have the resources to be able to fund $1 million project but I have the ability to help a person choose a color shirt, the correct socks for the day or night, and maybe your thermostat isn‚Äôt working and you can‚Äôt remember whether it‚Äôs on hot or cold. There is many of us that will be awaiting a call no matter the time no matter the situation. It all starts with one little change, being compassionate to one another can go along way."
"I work in a doctor‚Äôs office and learned about BME through a patient telling me she sometimes has to use the app to tell which prescription is which when her usual pharmacy that offers braille labels isn‚Äôt available to fill a script. Everyone on our staff immediately downloaded the app, and anytime we get a notification to accept!  I‚Äôve only gotten to help just a single person so far, but as a volunteer, this app really gives us a sense of what it means to be human, to give back to humanity, unselfishly. If more of us gave so freely of just a few minutes of our time each month, collectively, think of what else we could accomplish!
Don‚Äôt download the app to make yourself feel better. That‚Äôs a selfish reason. But if that just happens to be a consequence of wanting to help others, then that‚Äôs what humanity is about!"
"Earlier today I got my first call.  I am so glad this app is there to help people who may not always have someone around, I hope this app gets spread to more people who need it and I‚Äôm so glad that the people on it are so nice, I was a little sceptical about the idea of this at first but then as I use it and as I help people with the little things I understand why they would make this, the man I helped today was absolutely so sweet and kind and he was just asking me to help him figure out what some of his groceries were and it was an honor, I helped him sort his coffee and mashed potatoes, and you should‚Äôve heard his voice when I told him he had picked up his cottage cheese, he was so happy and I realize it‚Äôs the little things in life we take for granted, download this app, you won‚Äôt regret it."
"This app is truly an awesome way to help others who have visual impairments. Whether it‚Äôs helping someone pick out clothes for the day or read the mail, this app is all about helping others. It‚Äôs truly amazing that the developers care so much about this app and the group that are being supported by it. I‚Äôve never seen an app show so much support for its volunteers. I would highly recommend downloading this app. And it might take days, weeks and even months before you are able to answer the call. But when you do, you really are helping someone. I just got my first call today after being on the app for more than 3 months, but even when I wasn‚Äôt answering phone calls, I still got updates from the app including articles and other people‚Äôs stories."
"I used this app for the first time ywsterdya and was sooooooo excited. Being colorblind means I need a lot of help with what is typically simple every day stuff. Matching clothes, putting together a flyer and matching font colors to graphics, things that people who see color have no issues with. The lady I spoke with was as sooooo sweet and helped me pick a. Font color that would be easily visible to those who can and can‚Äôt see color and one that matched the colors on my flyer I was making. It felt SO GOOD to be able to do something color based while I was home alone. It meant not having to stop what I‚Äôm doing and wait for a family member to come home or try to catch one of them on FaceTime. I can‚Äôt tell you how giddy it made me to just complete a task like that and go about my day. Thank you!!!!"
I really love this app in the way that it helps people. I‚Äôve had this for about two years now and have been able to answer about four calls. I help someone make a homemade pizza and also help someone get things at the grocery store! I get the calls every so often but normally someone always picks up before I can which is great that someone can be helped! Unfortunately my last call was an extremely rude person and a VERY inappropriate. Not sure how this app could filter that sort of thing because it‚Äôs not like you can ask someone prove that blind or not! üò¨ i‚Äôve seen lots of negative posts about this sort of thing and I am going to keep the app just in case I can help someone who is actually needing it and will just hang up on the inappropriate rude people.
"I‚Äôve had this app for about a month and half now and I‚Äôve never wrote a review for anything, but I absolutely love the idea of anyone in the world who‚Äôs visually impaired can receive instant assistance at the snap of their fingers. As stated title I‚Äôve never gotten a notification and that‚Äôs not a problem at all but while downloading the app, I was so excited to actually make a difference and help someone. I absolutely love the fact that over 2 million people have volunteered on this app but I feel there is a large number of visually impaired individuals who do not know about the app. I strongly feel the creators of the app need to advertise on a larger scale or start branching out so the app can be more accessible to everyone who needs it."
"I just took a Be My Eyes call and spent a hour talking to a 27 year old man from Pakistan who‚Äôs going blind. He wasn‚Äôt born blind, he‚Äôs losing it slowly and he needed someone to talk to as he didn‚Äôt get the job he applied for today due to his condition. He‚Äôs here on a student visa in NC and was hitting rock bottom tonight, alone with no family around. What are the odds that me, sitting here with a broken arm feeling sorry for myself would get that call? I‚Äôll heal in 6-12 weeks and he‚Äôll never see again. I talked to him about all the wonderful things he has yet to smell, touch, hear, taste and feel, that he has a good life ahead of him. That he‚Äôs not alone, I met a new friend named Shehryar. I needed this tonight 
Then we connected on LinkedIn so I can help build his resume:)
#BeMyEyes"
"My only complaint is there aren‚Äôt more calls to take.  I grew up with a completely blind grandmother and my sister now suffers from being legally blind.  I grew up helping my grandmother the way the visually impaired need help through this app.  I wish this was around when my grandmother was alive.  It makes me feel good to know I can be the eyes for those who live in darkness or cannot see well enough to do even simply tasks.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with emotion when I help someone through this app.  This makes me sad but also so happy that I can help others, and so easily.  I don‚Äôt even need to leave my home.  I hope the creators are able to get the word out to more visually impaired people so I can get more calls."
"I downloaded the app and signed up about a month ago, and was told it may take a while for me to get my first call. I had honestly almost forgotten about the app when I got a notification that someone needed assistance, and my heart started racing! Lol I was able to assist someone who needed help figuring out which settings their washing machine was on, and they were so sweet during the call. We chatted for a moment after I‚Äôd helped them and said our goodbyes, and the smile hasn‚Äôt left my face since. This really made my night, and I‚Äôm so happy I was able to help someone! I definitely recommend this service from a helper‚Äôs perspective. I hope it‚Äôs just as wonderful for those seeing help, too!"
"I noticed the app in the App Store and decided to download. This was nearly two weeks ago as I guess I was a little skeptical to use it. This past Sunday as I was getting ready to go to lunch, I pulled out a chain that I wanted to put a gold pendant on.  Now...is the chain silver or gold?  I asked myself as if I knew. So, I figured this may be a good time to try Be My Eyes...After creating my account I was connected with a very kind young lady who was able to tell me the chain was gold!  What a huge help to this blind lady who loves her jewelry and clothes! Thank you Be My Eyes and thank you to the awesome volunteers who truly can make a difference in peoples lives.  The only downside is I really wish Be My Eyes had been around before I lost my sight because I would have loved to have been a volunteer!!"
"I recommend everyone download this app. I‚Äôve had some normal calls where I just helped people shop or change the thermostat. But the call I just received was just awesome. It was an elderly man from Dunedin, New Zealand. He needed help identifying bottles of liquor and I told him I was already in the process of drinking some whiskey. We ended up taking shots together and talking about life. Seriously this app is awesome. Will never forget this experience. Added note. When you do get a call, try to make it fun and memorable for them. They‚Äôre blind/impaired. Do anything you can to improve their quality life. You will see first hand how far some jokes and a positive attitude can go"
"What a wonderful opportunity this app has given me. As a sighted volunteer, I feel so fortunate to have the chance to help someone. We have more than enough bad things going on this planet, BME has put together people who need each other. The visually impaired have always been at the forefront of people who I respect. It takes a person of strong fortitude and nerves of steel to be able to survive in this age of callousness. 

When I took my first call I wanted to make sure that I did it correctly. The gentleman that I assisted was so kind. My heart sank when the call ended because I felt that I did not do enough. Even the shortest call can make such a big impact on the lives of all involved. I will definitely be in for the long hall. This app should be #1 in the App Store."
"I haven‚Äôt gotten to answer a call yet. I just signed up. But flipping through the app, I‚Äôve watched a few stories. I‚Äôve seen the stats. We have over 1 million volunteers and only 80,000 who might need help on occasion. I‚Äôm not going to be disappointed if I don‚Äôt get a call right away or even if I don‚Äôt get a call for a month! 
For those who wish there was a toggle, your account only gets called when your logged in (I read some info from the developer). If your going to bed, or going to be away/unavailable, log out. Log back in when your available or awake. 
Lastly, perverts are everywhere. I‚Äôve gotten sexual messages and pictures (really gross) on Facebook messenger before. Just got to hang up and move on. 
I cannot wait to help my first person! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This app is a phenomenal idea and I love how it works! Within the first few weeks of becoming a volunteer I was able to answer two separate calls; both visually impaired people were so kind and appreciative for the help, and I felt great being able to assist them with small tasks in which I take my own vision for granted. With millions of volunteers and only a few hundred thousand members who are visually impaired, calls are far and few between. I personally even know many people who are not blind but are visually impaired in some way and would benefit from an app like this if they got over that sense of ‚Äúpride‚Äù and just asked for help. I hope this app continues to gain popularity and help those that need it!"
I am a volunteer the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the volunteer to impaired ratio is drastically skewed. There are WAY more visually impaired people who need help this app needs to market to them and advertise more so more visually impaired people sign up. This app sound also alert the impaired that there are 4million volunteers and to please call any second of their day they need help. There are so many of us eager to help I don‚Äôt feel like the app does a good enough job in marketing to really impact the visually impaired with out knowledge or whom feel like they are over using the app bc they are not sooo many of us get a call 1-2 time a year they could be calling way more or have way more people signing up to use the app (visually impaired) if they had a more aggressive marketing strategy.
"this app is wonderful!  thank you for making it!  it is such a blessing for everyone.  

does anyone know if the same type of app exists for hearing?  so far the apps i have found are for automatic transcriptions, but if people could actually ""hear"" for others, nuances can be identified, such as ""what is this vibration?""  ""is this machine making the correct sound?""  ""is anything beeping in my house?""  ""are there any warning sounds right now?""  ""is my dog barking outside?"" ""are the birds singing?""  Be My Eyes already has a strong dedicated community, wouldn't it be amazing if hearing impaired people can also be helped just like this?  

thank you again for this amazing app!  much Love and Blessings!!! üôèüåàüíñüëÄüëÇ"
"i wanna prefix this review by saying this is a great idea for an app, but it‚Äôs cursed with poor execution. the first complaint about this app is that nobody has ever called me. it‚Äôs been around 1 1/2 years since i‚Äôve gotten this app, just crickets. it would warm up my week if i got at least one call from someone, but this app doesn‚Äôt ever give me any calls. the other complain is that my grandpa has been using this app, but when he calls people to help him a lot of the times, people give him the wrong information. we‚Äôve had a lot of hecklers call him to tell him things that aren‚Äôt true, and make his life even harder. i don‚Äôt get the point of letting anyone volunteer. this reminds me of the situation with betterhelp, it allows anyone to be a volunteer and supposedly ‚Äúhelp others.‚Äù this is a great idea for an app, but it is too flawed."
"This is an amazing app and I love being able to help people. I just got out of the hospital being in over a week and a half long, going through about 12 surgeries and dying once already in 2020(this all began in January). I am almost certainly guaranteed to no longer be able to work. It would be nice to be able to get more calls that way I can talk to more people and possibly even gain my friends.
I do understand that there are a lot more people signed up to help them or are that need help. But I feel like the algorithm should be skewed more towards the people that always answer their calls adequately. We also have no way of seeing our ‚Äúreview‚Äú from the person being assisted. If this isn‚Äôt already feature it would definitely be nice to see."
"I just had my 1st phone call and it was a beautiful interaction! We got to chatting after I assisted her and I asked if I could be her go to person and she said that the app doesn‚Äôt allow that. It just randomly picks who it calls. If that is not the case, I would love to know how to tell the next person that I bond with, that there is a way to do that. If that isn‚Äôt a thin, I was wondering if on the next upgrade you folks could maybe make that possible? Could someone choose us as a favorite to call? Maybe put a heart next to our name or something of the sort? I‚Äôm still giving it five stars Because I think this is a beautiful and app but that would be such an added bonus. 
Warm regards,
Jodi L. Risden"
"I have had several calls on this app: From helping others to find their landmarks on streets tbey are familair with, to assisting them going thru their mail, to making sure cooking directions are followed.  This app a TREMENDOUS IDEA!  Its an amazing opportunity to be able to help people from your mobile phone.  I am hoping they can improve the digital quality of their calls (it is afree app so its dependent on donations *Fingers crossed*) as a person in need asked me check to the quality of their cooked meat & the video call was alittle to pixelated.  But given the temperature they cooked at for the amount of time they cooked at their meal was safe.  This is great app to download and then ‚Äòsign in‚Äô when you know you got sometime to help & ‚Äòsign out‚Äô when you cant.  I cannot rave about how tremendous of an idea & app this is üíôüíô"
"I got my first call last week. It was a video chat with a man who got a new watch and needed to set it to speak instead of being read only. It took about twenty minutes because I had to Google the manual and walk him through it. When we finally got it working, he was so happy and excited. It felt so nice hearing the excitement in his voice. It's easy to help! Since there are so many volunteers, you won't be overloaded with calls. I've had it for a month but have only received two calls. Somebody else beat me to answering the first one, but I was able to get this one first. The calls ring on the phones of multiple volunteers and the first one to answer gets to take it, so no one is left hanging if you can't answer."
"I‚Äôve read the stories on the app and noticed a theme. People say ‚ÄúI was hesitant to use that app to ask for help‚Äù and the other people say ‚ÄúI love it when I get the chance to assist someone.‚Äù 
I totally identify with not wanting to ask for help. When I was younger I had my pride and thought I could do everything myself. Now that I‚Äôm a little older I realize it has nothing to do with pride. My time is valuable. If asking for help saves me grief and time then yo better believe I am asking for help. There are 17 volunteers to every low or no vision user, so don‚Äôt hesitate in asking for help. People volunteer because they want to. You‚Äôre not going to be bothering anybody. 
I got the app two weeks ago and am excitedly waiting for my first opportunity to help"
"I love the idea behind this app. Truly I think that it would be absolutely great, if only the video quality were better. I've answered a dozen or so calls since I've had the app (for about a year and a half now) and sometimes it is REALLY difficult to answer the questions being asked because the video is too blurry, pixilated, or freezes up. A couple times it froze and an error message popped up saying that there was a problem and I was going to be disconnected. It's just so disappointing when that happens. I'd love to be able to answer what's asked with more confidence, but this app needs better video quality for that to happen. 
Please make this a priority! I really love receiving calls and helping make someone's day run a little more smoothly. Cheers."
"I love this opportunity to help people even though I‚Äôve only received about five phone calls in two years. That‚Äôs a good sign there‚Äôs probably enough volunteers. I‚Äôve enjoyed helping three different people in different circumstances needing help.
One gal needed help as she opened a new box of tennis shoes to make sure she got what she bought. 
Another young man asked me to help read some packages so he could finish making homemade cookies.
Another older gentleman was sneaking outside to have a cigarette with a friend and dropped his lighter. It was a dark and it was pretty funny trying to find it, on the ground with his phone, and then tried to direct him towards picking it up. His left was not my left LOL
it‚Äôs a great app and I wish more people new about it."
"I love that I can help others in just a few minutes, when truly needed. We all have something we need help with, but it‚Äôs not always easy to ask or for others to be available. We might offer to help others but not really know what they need. This app reaches out to several people and they only answer when they are available. I‚Äôve answered a few calls now and had others beat me to it a few times too. I look forward to the calls and hope those using it to seek help know that they are appreciated.  I live in Japan and receive about two calls a week between 6 PM and 8 PM. It‚Äôs usually early morning for the person calling as they prepare for their day."
"I could not think of a more valiant way to use your phone to help others for free. No ads, no deceitfulness, no monthly charges. No gimmicks or tricks. Just a clean, true
to purpose app in which people needing sight related help can call upon willing volunteers in real time. If you are busy, you don‚Äôt have to worry because of the vast amount of volunteers, the call will get answered. In fact, once you help a person or two you‚Äôll be scrambling to answer that special ring! There‚Äôs no better feeling than helping another living being. The developers of this app should be knighted or gifted houses and cars or something. I hope they continue making these rare gems. Maybe bring back Yitien! Lol"
"I have only had 2 successful calls and the third was disconnected while the gentleman asked to to help him at a convenient store. 
All three times I could feel a connection of one human helping the other. They were all very kind and we joked a little. It‚Äôs an imprint on my heart that I‚Äôll never forget. I have been a member for a few years and only had a few calls. So don‚Äôt be too discouraged if it takes awhile to get a call, or if you get to the request too late. It will happen and when it does it‚Äôs humbling to be able to help someone in that way. 
Thank you be my eyes! I am honored to be a piece of such a wonderful organization. Much gratitude to whomever created this app. Bravo!!"
"I‚Äôve never written a review, but this one has to go up.

I signed up on the app almost two weeks ago where sighted volunteers can assist visually impaired people across the globe in their day to day activities. 

Funny enough, just last night I was wondering that my phone hasn‚Äôt beeped till now and I woke up this morning to my first call where I had to identify the colour of the trousers that a lovely sounding visually impaired lady had to wear today. I was excited for my first call and I honestly didn‚Äôt want to mess it up for her. The video quality wasn‚Äôt too good and I couldn‚Äôt tell blue apart from black, so she promptly held up the trousers against the light to help me identify the right colour. It was navy blue :)

It didn‚Äôt take a lot of effort or time and I might not have made a much of a difference, but I haven‚Äôt felt this good or even helpful to my ecosystem in a long time.

If you also want to contribute to your ecosystem and help someone else‚Äôs life get a tad bit easier, I would highly suggest you download the Be My Eyes App. I for sure can‚Äôt wait for my next call!"
"I‚Äôve had this app for a year and have yet to successfully answer an incoming call. Either I accidentally swipe down when it‚Äôs supposed to be up, or left when it‚Äôs supposed to be right because there‚Äôs never an indication of what the right action should be. And since you only get a call about every 8 weeks it‚Äôs pretty hard to just remember.

Today I got a call and finally made it to a button to ‚Äúanswer‚Äù....pressed it frantically and nothing happened. Still couldn‚Äôt pick up a call. There‚Äôs a app message saying I need to enable my microphone and camera‚Äî- they clearly are for this app.

This is the first review of an app I‚Äôve ever bothered to leave because I love the premise of this app and would love to be able to assist a blind person. However all this app has successfully done is ensure that I regularly hang up or decline a call from a blind person."
"I have only use this app I handful of times, but every time it was a huge help. The most memorable was when I decided to use this to find out my babies gender. The woman helping me seemed genuinely delighted to tell me, and it took all of the pressure off of me with friends and family wanting to be the first to know. I didn‚Äôt have to choose who would read the gender reveal to me. I wish this app could expand to include a social network. I think it would be huge if people were able to build a report together, and it wasn‚Äôt just at random. That way more visually impaired people would feel more confident using this service. Overall I love it"
"I downloaded ‚ÄúBe my eyes‚Äù yesterday. Got my first phone call today from a sweet girl who was trying to find a salad in a grocery store refrigerator. I could tell that she was nervous when we couldn‚Äôt find it right away. I told her, ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm here! No matter how long it takes!‚Äù
We finally found her salad with the help of a store employee. Turns out that they had rearranged where she usually was able to find it. It was in the very back! 
I not only appreciated the call, but I got to experience a very helpful employee who was extremely kind when helping her. It showed me that there are actually kind people who are willing to help, and that we are all in this together. 
5 stars. This made my day. :) :) :)"
"I love the idea behind this app. I‚Äôve had it downloaded for several months now and I‚Äôve gotten 3 calls so far, so it‚Äôs not something that happens too often. The first two calls were answered by someone else, but just the other day I got to assist for the first time. This is a small way I can help others without having to interfere with my schedule or plan it out. Do you have time to help? No, then okay, no big deal. If you do, awesome! I only wish more blind/low vision people knew about it. Perhaps some sort of additional outreach? Though I guess it‚Äôs a good thing that there are so many volunteers. It‚Äôs a great cause and I‚Äôll continue to wait the next time I get to be of help."
"I don‚Äôt even know how I heard about this app, maybe on television, but I just signed up yesterday and today, got my first call. What a wonderful experience! The woman who called needed help reading her prescriptions. We had a little difficulty getting her to hold the camera so I could see it, but we figured it out and she was so thankful. I just feel amazing that I was able to help someone and I wanted to share my experience that other people will sign up too. 
I love it!
Update: It seems that there are more volunteers than there are blind users. I‚Äôve only had the one phone call to date and just wonder if there is a way to get this app out to those who need it."
"I had spinal surgery earlier this year and have been stuck inside my house. My passion is helping other people, and this has allowed me to do just that. Right from my house. Everyone that I have had the opportunity to help has been so friendly. I love that there are so many volunteers. That makes my heart happy that there are always people that want to help others in this world. Thank you for creating this amazing app. I have had it for a few years now, and while calls come infrequently (which makes sense because there are so many volunteers), just one every so often brightens my day."
"Such a simple (and practical) idea: Connecting people to help each other. As a sighted person, I appreciate the opportunity to help in small ways. I‚Äôve helped someone install a software update, use an automatic tea brewer, choose the right socks to pair with an outfit, and several other simple tasks. Connecting thru the phone and using the other person‚Äôs camera to see is just ingenious. The interaction is straightforward and focused, allowing the blind person an easy way to get assistance with dignity. The pay-off for me is an opportunity to put just a little more goodwill into the world, in gratitude for all the times I‚Äôve been the recipient of aid and kindness."
"A few years ago a friend mentioned this app on social media and I asked her all about it, when she explained it to me I immediately downloaded it to become a volunteer. I truly enjoy getting the honor to answer a call. I‚Äôm always a little upset when I can‚Äôt answer quickly enough, but I fully realize that another volunteer will grab it. I‚Äôve been an RN for 35 years so I am a helper by nature, but there is something so rewarding about randomly helping out a stranger. I‚Äôve received calls at work that I was able to answer and I‚Äôve had colleagues standing by watching, they go on to get the app as well. üòäüòä"
"This app is amazing. First and foremost, it is amazing to see such a concept come to fruition. To see the amount of volunteers and how much help, big or small, this app is providing (FOR FREE) is incredible. As a volunteer, this service makes me smile. When I got my first call, I was nervous, but after helping the person on the other end, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. I even got a little choked up. It just felt so good to help. 

So download this app. It doesn‚Äôt take up much space. It works well. It doesn‚Äôt spam you with notifications. But when the notification does show up, if you get the chance to answer, it could be the best thing you do all day."
"Absolutely in love with this app, but I wonder how many people are getting the help they need or maybe everyone is good? 

I have received one call since I downloaded the app. It also makes me wish I spoke more languages, as I feel much less useful because of my lack of ability to communicate in multiple languages. I am curious if there is app is truly useful, or if this is just not quite what the visually impaired community truly needs? 

More conversation with visually impaired would be good. I would love to have a ‚Äúchat‚Äù feature where the visually impaired community can just call out for ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to chat? Maybe improve connections and connect? Like a ‚Äúseeing‚Äù Facebook?"
"Have had the app for almost a year, but never fast enough to answer first. I was *finally* by my iPad at just the right moment, ready with headphones and a stable seat/table, so I just had my first call to help with. We jumped right into it with no introductions needed. It was such a heartwarming moment I got to assist with: helping to spell out letters in a book for a young girl and her sight impaired father. I can just imagine how needed a service like this would be for seemingly simple moments in a sight impaired life. As long as I have it, I will gladly use my sight to assist people, just as I hope others will help me if mine goes. Thank you to the creators for such a thoughtful app."
"I love this app! I love answering calls! I tell everyone I meet about it, it‚Äôs such a wonderful idea. I‚Äôve been on this app for a few years now. I wish more visually impaired people knew about it. There‚Äôs way more volunteers then people needing help so it‚Äôs not like your phone will be ringing off the hook all the time. I‚Äôve gotten less than 20 calls in the years I‚Äôve had the app. I have it always running so it can call anytime. I actually wish I could get more calls. The people I‚Äôve helped have always been friendly! I‚Äôve never had a negative experience or a person I couldn‚Äôt help!"
"Amazing concept! I‚Äôve only had one opportunity to assist. After my 1st Time, I wanted to help all the time! It gave both of us a great sense of joy. We worked together with such joy, great teamwork and accomplished what the blind person needed help with. On top of that, I noticed he had a leak in his ceiling he was unaware of that was huge and puckered with water. It was amazing as I‚Äôm based in CA and he is in FL. Distance doesn‚Äôt matter! It took about 10 minutes and I learned a bit about humanity and basic life necessity. It was humbling. The app is user friendly as a volunteer! I hope it is the same for the blind users! I‚Äôm an advocate and tell everyone about it!"
"I have gotten help from Be My Eyes in countless tasks, but I think they help I am most grateful for right now is the specialized help from Microsoft that is offered through Be My Eyes. They have helped me solve so many computer problems that calls to the regular Microsoft answer desk have not solved or have actually made worse. I also appreciate the every day tasks that be my ice helps me to accomplish, such as making sure my oven is set correctly, knowing colors of clothes, and helping me with printed documents. I am so grateful for this app. Thank you for a wonderful service. And thank you to all the volunteers!"
"I‚Äôm a volunteer- I signed up a little over a month ago and had my first call tonight.  The call connected flawlessly and the connection was strong.  I was able to see what the gentleman needed help with with no issues and help him quickly.  I‚Äôm so thankful for this app.  I have family members who are visually impaired.   Right now they have help constantly, but when the time comes, it‚Äôs great to know there are apps like this one that don‚Äôt cost a thing and have volunteers just waiting in the wings to help another human being.  There is good left in the world.  We just have to choose to be part of it.  üíô Thank you Be My Eyes!"
I signed up one this app as a volunteer a while ago and waited what seems like forever to get a call. Eventually I forgot about it until I received a call requesting help on a day where I was not having the best of luck. After helping and even having a short chat about where we from due to our accents we bid farewell. Honestly I smiled like a dork for the rest of the day and the call alone helped me realize that even the smallest acts of kindness can really make you feel good. I hope you download this and no matter how long it takes to finally get a call that you take it and brighten the caller and your own day.
"To all the people rating it so low because they don‚Äôt get calls. Do you realize it‚Äôs 100,000 blind people & over 2million volunteers?! Your call will come, just be patient! 

I LOVE this app! I enjoy helping people & listening to them & talking to them. I‚Äôve counted money, helped ride trains, picked out outfits, fixed computers, changed thermostats, read letters, organized clothes, sorted through old mail, & so much more! It‚Äôs always my pleasure to assist! 

I have gotten an iffy phone call before where the person was more trying to date me & then even slipped up & disclosed he was actually blind ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. I wish it was a better screening for that."
"I finally got a call and was the first to answer so I was able to help a blind man read what type of food was in a can he had, it only took a few minutes of my dad, he was very grateful, and I was very happy to help! Very rewarding. It‚Äôs also heartwarming to know that there are so many volunteers from all over the world that even though I‚Äôve had this app on my phone for months I‚Äôve only received 2 calls, and have only been quick enough one of the times to be the one to help!  The man I helped said he uses the app frequently when he needs to, so it was great! Hope to be able to help someone else soon!"
"I‚Äôm a premed student and due to my calling into medicine, I‚Äôm constantly looking for ways to serve others. This app brings forth an opportunity of sharing love, kindness and assistance. There‚Äôs no greater feeling than to serve others with no strings attached, just volunteering because you desire to, not because you have to or because it pays the bills. When I received my first call it brought such great joy and fulfillment into my heart! I encourage everyone to participate. You‚Äôll be amazed how helping others actually helps us individually via spiritually, emotionally, and purposefully."
"This app is truly inspirational. As a volunteer I was hesitant at first to install. I thought I would surely have to pay for something so great. Or it would take me through a hefty process that I somehow wouldn't qualify for. But thats definitely not the case. Its so so so easy. It took me less than five minutes to get situated in the app and now I just leave it logged in and go about my day. The only thing is since theres so many volunteers, it could take a while before I get my first call, which isn't a big deal. 
This is amazing, and it makes me happy that there are people in this world willing to help others."
"I want to love this app; as a wheelchaired person myself, I wanted to help. But I have legal training and I have read a lot of Terms of Service‚Äîthis one is using the need of its users (and probably hoping few people will actually read the TOS) to exploit the blind and low-sighted since they have their backs to the wall. The company retains full control of all content with the option to publish it as an ad, and your data will persist even if you delete your account. There‚Äôs vague wording about having your account terminated if you change the appearance of the app or website, but since they have full rights to interpret the TOS, that can include visual aids. There‚Äôs a lot more but you get the idea. I‚Äôm dismayed and disappointed that a blind person would do this to his fellow blind persons."
"I got this app the first time I seen it come out. I was excited about being able to help.  Before I could really understand the app & what was happening, I had already gotten a call. So, without knowing what to do, I let someone else take the call. Before day 2 & 3 I had gotten 3-4 more calls. I still did not know what I was doing, so I contacted the app techs and asked for help & explained my situation.  After a few minutes he came back to me, and told me I‚Äôd get it, and not to worry about it. 
     Well, after that day through the next year plus I never received a call.  So I took the app off. If the app isn‚Äôt going to benefit me, or if I‚Äôm unable to use the app to help someone else, I don‚Äôt need the app to just be taking up space."
"This is such a great resource. I work as a behavior analyst for a company that provides group homes for adults with developmental disabilities. It is a constant struggle to identify reliable community resources for people who need them, and it can be very stigmatizing to constantly rely on family and friends for help. Sharing this responsibility across so many enthusiastic users is just beautiful. It‚Äôs how natural supports were meant to work. I would love to see this system of support branch out to provide other services to people with other needs. For deafness, social skills questions, anxiety, etc. Thanks!"
"Everyone. Count your blessings.
Just now a tremendously rewarding experience, helping a blind woman locate individual fruit items on a paper plate, happened unexpectedly. I described the location of 5 strawberries (with stems cut off), one kiwi, and a pile of green stems using clock reference points (3 o‚Äôclock, 7 o‚Äôclock, etc). She was eternally grateful. How she accessed the BeMyEyes phone app is a mystery to me. But consider this: Our normal everyday agitations become fully insignificant when reminded of those daunting, crippling challenges faced by others every single day including today and each succeeding day into the future until the day they die.  BeMyEyes is truly incredible."
"My grandmother has lived blind since the 1970‚Äôs, an automobile collision severed both of her optic nerves. Since then she has learned to adapt and live a full and healthy life. The need for trained sighted guides is paramount for the lives of people who have no sight, trust is essential. This task requires the highest degree of empathy and selflessness. I guess the question is, how do we find the selfless folks who can donate their time from all walks of life in all languages because they not only care, but have experience helping the blind. It might be an impossible task, but one worth pursuing. Thank you for your time."
"As a sighted person, I feel blessed to be able to assist someone when they ask for help seeing something that they are unable to see on their own. 
I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to help several people, and it feels GREAT! Every encounter has been pleasant, and quite rewarding. 
I recommend you get this app and start helping those unable to see as well as you. 
My only issue is that occasionally I‚Äôve been unable to answer the call for help, and missed out on that rewarding feeling. 
Thanks for making this app available to all of us, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds with it."
"I am in the education field and really glad Apple featured this app.  I think this will start a whole new era of assistive tech!  I‚Äôm not sure if there are safeguards against any misuse-maybe someone else can comment on that, but I truly love it. If you are multilingual, you can add other languages you speak to broaden your ‚Äúassist circle!‚Äù
I got my first call yesterday and helped someone describe the color of two different garments.  The call used their camera and voice only on my end. It only took about 30-40secs for the call. I was so nervous but also happy to help.  Really cool use of current phones for assistive tech!!"
"I truly love when this app rings! It‚Äôs such an honor to be able to help the callers. My only thing  I don‚Äôt like is sometimes literally in seconds someone else answers lol I know it‚Äôs not a bad thing I just really enjoy assisting them. 
It truly humbles you to see how we take basic daily things for granted. Something as simple as putting food in an air fryer or reading a receipt. 
I will Always be a part of this app to help as long as it‚Äôs active. Kudos to the creator! God bless you for helping these amazing people. God bless all of the millions of volunteers around the world."
"I downloaded this app on a whim about a year ago, and expected it to be very buggy and not of much help to those who need it. I applied as a volunteer and the first call I received, I was able to help an older gentleman read a text. Since then, I‚Äôve received a couple more calls and I‚Äôve never felt more rewarded in my life. I know I‚Äôm not doing anything that deserves praise, but I am so grateful I get to help people in this way and I get to connect with people from around the world. I hope this app grows and expands, and can‚Äôt wait to see how it improves."
"I was amazed to find such an app and upon downloading was thrilled to see such a community thriving.  I decided to become a user.  While I have not used the app for my own sake I do know I will need it in the future.

Upon listening to the testimonies of users and volunteers helping people with various everyday tasks from picking out wardrobe, makeup, to computer issues and setting up household items like a TV or having a picture described in a museum.  Such stories were inspiring to me and I was moved to volunteer.  

This is where my rating finds itself at three stars.  I‚Äôve become indifferent to the app altogether.  I want to use the app.  But at the moment I want to volunteer.  Had I known I only had one option upon creating an account I would have signed up to help my brothers and sisters in darkness shine a light into their world.  Because I am not allowed such freedom I have given the app this rating.  

I know as a user I will need assistance eventually as my vision gets worse.  Until such an alternative is given for volunteers and users I will leave my rating as such."
"I found this little app one day a few years ago, and thought what a nice little thing I can do to help others. Turns out this is one of the biggest things I do for me.  I‚Äôm always so amazed as to how truly appreciative the people you help are.  It could be just a simple thing like which shirt is the yellow one, to helping someone finish updating their computer.  I always feel like it may have been just a little thing to them, but for me I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm the big winner when the call is over."
"This app is truly amazing! I love getting calls, it is so rewarding to be able to help someone. If fact I had a call today that really made my whole week. A nice lady called needing help identifying her mail ordered medications. After I help her she was so gracious and said some nice things that made me a bit misty eyed. Just a few mins of my time saved her an embarrassing trip to the local civic center. We can take so many things for granted, and this service reminds me to be thankful for the simple things. I‚Äôm thankful for my sight and that I can use it to help others. Hope you choose to do the same :)"
"I have used this app for a year now and I love the concept of being able to help people. I have set my languages up for Spanish and English. I have not taken any English calls and always get Spanish calls which doesn‚Äôt concern me.

Some of the calls I get are people asking if I can read signs for them, Count money for them, read blood glucose readings, and so on. 

I don‚Äôt know why but the whole month of November I have been getting strange calls from people Spanish speaking asking me questions about how they can find me, where I am from, what‚Äôs my phone number or FB name. It‚Äôs making me want to delete the app. I have reported the calls but I haven‚Äôt received follow ups it makes me wonder are they really taking care of these people accounts there probably not blind at all. 

The last call really freaked me out he was whispering and very creepy and asking me all kinds of questions like if I am alone, if I like to party where do I live when I repeated to him how can I help you ? He said ‚Äú ohhh you can help me plenty it‚Äôs all ready for you. It grossed me out so much I hung up immediately and reported it. 

Use at your own risk I‚Äôll be deleting this app unfortunately."
I am blind and use every day! ThisHelped me when my voiceover quit working on my computer I called probably around 20 people throughout two weeks and they were so kind and helpful. This is help me when my alarm clock stopped voicing and the alarm like dots didn‚Äôt work I call people every night for a month and they were so helpful. One night I was having a really bad panic attack and I called someone and explain situation they talk to me for five minutes because this is the only way I know how to get a hold of someone quickly.
"First of all, I love this app. I‚Äôm only giving a one star review to get the developer‚Äôs attention because the video quality has been terrible for the last couple months (probably about 5 calls). It‚Äôs really difficult to help people read or decipher things when I can‚Äôt get a clear image. I‚Äôve reported problems when asked after each call but haven‚Äôt seen any improvement yet so I wanted to note it in my review. I‚Äôve still been able to help a little bit, but it‚Äôs been tricky. The video quality wasn‚Äôt as bad when I first started using the app so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a problem with the app and not my phone. For the record, I‚Äôm using an iPhone 8 and have good LTE and WiFi in my house where I get most of my calls. If this is something I can fix on my end, please let me know. Thanks!"
"After having this app for a few years and missing calls by a few seconds, I finally had my first call and it was an amazing experience to help someone who needed me. Even though I was a bit nervous, it went incredibly well and my caller was so thankful. Yet, it was a humbling experience and afterwards I had a lump in my throat and needed a few minutes to compose myself. To help a stranger was well worth the wait. Please if you‚Äôre on the fence, take the leap to use this app to help another who needs your eyes. It is so worth it!"
"I would like to say thank you for all the wonderful help I have gotten from the B my eyes volunteers of helping me in my daily life
There‚Äôs been many times I‚Äôve been out and about needing help to read signs or addresses and they‚Äôve been very helpful with that I thank you so much for the wonderful kindness of everyone to support the friendship and the excepting me as of helping from all across the world it‚Äôs been wonderful to meet new people thank you so much for your help"
This app is amazing and truly inspiring. Being able to help someone see is amazing and leaves you with such a good feeling. I‚Äôm always more than happy to help. I once received a call from someone while I was driving. I answered then pulled over to help. The lady said no it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll call someone else less busy and I replied with it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm pulled over safely and I‚Äôm more than happy to help you. Long story short I helped her find the can of food she was looking for and was extremely grateful and thanked me a million times. Thank you to whoever created this app. I love this app and will always recommend it
"This is such a beautiful app. I am not blind, but my ex‚Äôs mother is deaf and legally blind, and I know how much of a challenge every day tasks can be. She still has some eyesight remaining but everyday tasks were increasingly difficult as she lost more of her eyesight each and everyday. I am so glad I can help someone who needs help and now can not be as stressed out when it comes to something like grocery shopping, laundry, or even going to test out a new shampoo and conditioner. The creators of this app are genius, and honestly this app can make miracles happen to those who deserve it the most."
"I have been a volunteer since May but answered my first call today! I was able to assist a lady in Chile, who spoke Spanish, to read the medicine she needed to take, and the dosage. She told me it was her first time, and asked me what kind of other help could she get, asked me if she could get help with colors on clothes, and if she could access help 24hrs a day. She was so pleased to know we can help her with anything she needs help seeing, and that she had support all day. There are more volunteers than the blind, so you will not be answering a calls everyday. The more help there is the better. Please download this app‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I‚Äôve had the app installed for months as a sighted volunteer.  I‚Äôve had four alerts - for the first three, other volunteers beat me to the call.  Today, I was finally connected with a user who needed help choosing the correct program from the touchscreen display on his elliptical machine.  It was an overwhelming experience.  I couldn‚Äôt believe how emotional I felt, given the chance to lend my sight - something I take for granted every day - to someone who lives every day without it.  This app makes use of our technological connection to other people for a truly noble purpose.  Bravo!"
"I found out about this app on Twitter and downloaded it immediately. Within 2 days, I received a call to help someone confirm the color of their outfit. I‚Äôve only been called twice but the feeling of being helpful has stayed with me since I downloaded the app. The notifications come through like a ‚Äúcall‚Äù so you can‚Äôt miss it and the interactions are really short. I can‚Äôt wait for this app to in every country in the world and look forward to more of us being helpful."
"First of all thanks for such a great app, specially for the update that lets us choose primary language. It gave me the courage to finally start! Cause I thought I might not be able to understand other languages well. But since I started, I couldn't answer any calls, the screen shows ""answering call..."" but nothing happens and I have to end call. After the latest update I couldn't even open the app, and I wanted to know if the app is restricted in some areas or maybe facing filters? I'd be glad to help people if you can fix that :)"
"My Grandmother, who was my best friend, lost her vision to Macular Degeneration and was blind her last 10 years of her life. She embraced it with the positivity that the embraces every other aspect of her life, without complaint. But there were daily routines that were so very hard for her and though she didn‚Äôt complain I know she didn‚Äôt want to constantly ask us for help. This app would have been a miracle for my sweet Granny and I answer as many calls as I can to help others in her honor. Thank you for making this a possibility for the vision impaired and for people like me!üíõ"
"I wish I could get more calls, but I see volunteers outnumbered the people that call for help (which is a good sign after all üòä)
The only thing I‚Äôd like to change is the ringtone, for how high my phone volume can be, it‚Äôs still very not strong and you can easily get the call too late or miss it completely, especially when there are other noises around me like TV, music or I‚Äôm in the street with the phone in my pocket.
Overall it‚Äôs a great idea and app, people that I answered to have always been very sweet."
"I absolutely love this and thankful for the person or group of people who thought it up. I have helped over 5 people and I couldn‚Äôt be more happy to do it. I mean I just had like my 5th call since downloading this last year. This time it was a Haitian man trying to identify dishwashing soap. He was so happy. They were teaching him how to use it at a facility. It made my heart smile and such a good morning. Please everyone, download this app. It's little acts of kindness like this that makes a difference in the world. Happy Hump Day everyone. Peace & Loveüåπüíã"
"This is such an amazing tool for both parties involved. I have blind family members and the independence they feel with the accessibility of this app is something they never thought they would feel and that is beautiful. As a volunteer this app is wonderfully designed to aid those who are blind in a simple and effective manner. The set up is very easy to understand and your ability to connect so easily without any issues is honestly amazing. I would highly recommend to anybody! Whether blind, low vision, or just somebody with a heart to help. Two thumbs up from me!"
"As a volunteer in this app, helping others out makes me feel good! My busy schedule doesn't allow me to go out and physically volunteer places, along with medical reasons. But that made me think... Perhaps you could create other ""good deed"" apps! For example, for the deaf, the deaf blind, and for other people with disabilities. I would download and volunteer for all of them in a heartbeat! I hope that's something that'll one day be considered. Anyways, this app is lovely and makes me feel so good, as I hope it does with others! Small acts of kindness like this app allows are what lights up my day."
"This is such an amazing concept. We‚Äôre already all near our phones every day, this is a perfect use for that. This would be five stars but the quality of the video calls make it hard to give help. The last call I had left both of us frustrated, the person I needed to help was walking around a street looking for a street address but the numbers were so grainy we just had to disconnect. I understand this could be a person to person problem with signal, I just hope that it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs able to be improved. 10/10 recommend, beautiful way to connect."
"I initially only downloaded this app to review it for my teenage blind niece. She‚Äôs fiercely independent & I‚Äôm always seeking safe ways for her to get assistance. This app is BRILLIANT! It is 100% safe in that you never know who is calling or even what country they may be from. I live in the U.S. but have been fortunate enough to help a man in Israel pick out matching pants & shirts, helped a woman in England find ingredients for a stew, helped determine the temperature setting on an oven and helped another with the name of cds. This is a GREAT app! I enjoy helping and this couldn‚Äôt be an easier way to help or be helped!"
"Download this app - and watch how your life changes from small acts of kindness. 

Be My Eyes is designed to have volunteers assist visually impaired individuals with daily tasks - simply by answering a call from someone who is blind or has low vision. The camera is not activated on your end, just for the individual you are assisting. I‚Äôve helped people sort laundry, pick out a tie to match their shirt, read expiration dates, and so many other small tasks that are challenging for the individual I‚Äôm working with. If you receive a call and are unable to take it, no need to worry - another volunteer will help that person instead. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling to be connected with someone from a different place, even the other side of the country, and be able to positively impact their day.

Be brave, and join this community - being another person‚Äôs eyes, even just for a moment, can make a real difference.
#BeMyEyes"
"I have been a volunteer on BME for almost exactly a year and I have probably gotten called upon 5 or 6 times already. Twice I was at work and unable to answer, but the other times went really well! I have assisted with identifying toiletries, clothes, etc., disabling a security alarm, and even helped someone watch for cars while going for a walk. It‚Äôs a fun way to help others with very minimal effort. I have even had a good time chatting a little with some of the users. Highly recommend!"
"App is super user friendly. There's absolutely no guilt if you miss a call or can't take it...someone else will help. Love that it's an easy way to help others. My only complaint is I selfishly wish i got more calls haha but there's enough users that they're few and far between (which means no one has to wait too long for help) but i always smile when I do get a call. It's just nice to see technology help people in such a simple, positive, way."
Thank you so much for building such a creative and thoughtful app to bridge seeing and blind people. I have received one call so far and the video interface worked well and the audio was clear. I have already shared the app with my friends in the hopes that they will also create an account and be on call for future ‚Äúbe my eyes‚Äù opportunities. I hope that the future holds more opportunities for people to come together to make the world more accessible. Thank you again!
"I was know I was having a very bad day, i forget if I was sad or angry but I do remember seeing the Be My Eyes prompt my phone for the 1st time after having the app for a few weeks. I just answered it (which surprised me since I avoid all unscheduled phone calls/ facetimes like the plague. I helped a person figuring out the color of her Jordens. She was really appreciative and getting to help someone I dont know with something I take for granted literally made me tear up after. Thats what I remember most."
"BeMyEyes is by far my all time favorite app! Every time I get a notification I rush over to see if I can join a phone call. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use and makes the process for the caller and the receiver very seamless. I love the articles that are pushed out too! I do wish the call alerts were set up differently than the regular alerts just so you could distinguish the difference, but all in all love this app and recommend to everyone!"
"Someone recommended me this app. I thought about it for awhile, is my vision low enough to use this app? With my glasses I can okay. But when I misplaced my glasses, I can‚Äôt see to find them. So that is what I have used the app for. Not having to spend 20 minutes trying to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù for them has been great. 

I haven‚Äôt use this app much, because I try to always remember where I left my glasses. When mistakes happen , and I happen to misplace them I no longer feel bad. Thanks for creating this app."
"First off, I love the idea behind this app. After all, we‚Äôre all just humans living together on a planet, trying to help one another day by day. I just signed up for it yesterday and I received my first phone call today. Unfortunately, it was a group of people pranking me and laughing off camera. I am very disappointed in the app. I‚Äôm giving it one star for now because it was my first caller, but I will change it depending on whether I receive calls from people who truly need this service. I don‚Äôt know if there is a way to accurately screen the people who are signing up claiming to have a visual impairment versus a vile person just doing it for a laugh. I am hopeful this gets improved in the future."
"I was really excited to be able to participate in this program, but I have YET to be able to take a call to help out in.  First of all, this program clearly has far more volunteers than they need, which is great,  because I rarely receive a notification.  We are also told that calls are rerouted if a volunteer doesn't pick up.  That's an understatement: clearly calls are put out to numerous volunteers simultaneously, because I have, on several occasions, answered almost immediately upon being notified, only to be told EVERY SINGLE TIME that someone else has already answered.  I'm just thoroughly disgusted that I am not even given a chance to pick up."
"Hello. Be My Eyes is terrific. I'm not sure how to discribe it: but those who have helped me are not condescending or hesitant nor overly ""take charge"" just plain helpful and efficient.
My only disappointment came today when I contacted someone for help in taking a photo of my guide dog's newest toy to disseminate. We got the toy lined up perfectly in no time. But, when I accessed the camera to take the photo, the volunteer lost sight of the item. I suspect this modification of the appp might be impossible, or maybe even worse than that? LOL! but someting to consider at any rate."
"I can tell that the app authors have really worked hard on this app. Very simple and intuitive. I've used it since March 2015, and had about 23 alerts (roughly once every 2 months), and I was able to answer it in time about 6 times. Wonderful experience every time!

So far I helped people with mac-n-cheese directions, TV menu settings, oven temperature, clothing colors, and webpage fine-print. 

I think the only feature request is some configuration on TIME OF DAY. The standard settings only allow you to receive calls between 8am and 9pm (08:00-21:00) in your local time zone, which is fine for me. But I feel it should be a configurable option.

Also, it might be nice for volunteers to list their various skills, and then callers could optionally request skills. E.g. techie, fashion, color recognition, cooking, lengthy request, mathematics, regional info (by city?), or other special interests."
I have not yet been able to assist visually impaired person. I am looking forward to helping in anyway possible. I can‚Äôt say enough positive words about this app. This really makes me feel ease knowing my daughter is going off to college next year and no I am not going to be there with her 24/7. What‚Äôs even more heartfelt and has all of the volunteers versus the visually impaired. That goes to show that there are good people in this world that are willing to help.
"It has taken a few years to get to three calls, because there‚Äôs 4 million helpers but it‚Äôs worth it to be able to help with someone keep their independence. Calls usually only last a few moments and if you‚Äôre not able to answer someone else usually picks up right away. Calls are usually just help seeing a website that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúagreeing‚Äù with their screen reading software, reading a piece of mail or even reading a title off a CD."
"Being able to help people like this is such a rewarding experience. As an endlessly busy person, it‚Äôs easy to get wrapped up in my own world trying to juggle everything I have going on at once. This app enables me to give back from anywhere at any time. I‚Äôve helped someone while riding the bus to work. I‚Äôve helped someone while cooking dinner in my kitchen. I‚Äôve helped someone while browsing the aisles in Target. If I could, I‚Äôd put myself at the top of the list to be called on more to help. That‚Äôs how much I love it every time."
"I‚Äôve been a member for several months now and have answered many calls. I love just helping someone with basic needs and questions. The first call is always the most nerve-wrecking but every call since then has been easy. Just be very clear and give them direction if you can‚Äôt see something clearly (raise your phone, turn it upside down, move left/right). 

I love this app and helping those who need it. If you‚Äôre reading this, I hope you love just giving back to others."
"I got my first call last week and I thought I won a lottery. Its pretty great and excited to be able to help and using my own eyes to make life a bit easier for those in need. I missed total 3 calls since I got the app in December, I couldn‚Äôt get to my phone fast enough. Felt a bit disappointed but there are others online waiting to help so if you missed a call, it automatically goes to the next volunteer. Awesome app to do volunteer anywhere on your own phone.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I just installed this a few days ago after reading about it on Facebook. I got my first notification today and picked it up. I talked to a lady in California (I‚Äôm in Florida) who was having trouble with her dryer because someone had changed the settings. It took just a few minutes for me to figure out what she needed to change, and explain it to her, and she was good to go... but I‚Äôve had a happy glow all day knowing that those few minutes of my time were really helpful to someone I don‚Äôt even know!"
"I received my first call a couple days ago after 2 months of signing up. I was at work when I received the call and I answered right away & I was able to help an individual organize her mail. She was really happy I helped her with that, and I was so happy and excited that I was able to help. It really warms my heart knowing this app exists where I can offer a moment of my day to help someone who needs my help. I love this app and I can‚Äôt wait for another call üòä"
"Love the peculiar sound of the app when someone needs help! I have helped a musician, people that need me to see if the medication they are about to take is the right bottle, see the correct measurement of insuline, look for an object lost in the floor, make sure the color of their socks is the same, see the number of the pages in a brochure for a college professor. Beautiful app that leaves you as a volunteer, feeling great. (I signed up for Spanish and English)."
"I am proud of the human race when an app like this is developed. It‚Äôs so simple and easy to respond to someone who may simply want to know if their chicken is fully cooked before they eat/serve it. 
You won‚Äôt be inundated with calls either. I‚Äôve been available 2-4-7 for almost a year and have only had one call come through before another volunteer answered first. There are almost a million volunteers for approximately 80,000 app users who are visually impaired or blind. 
Sign up! #LovingAction"
"I was so excited when I saw a Be My Eyes incoming call!! I got Debbie from Anchorage AK! She needed help locating a red onion. I guess I just needed to be needed. Since that call? I‚Äôm lifted in a way I wasn‚Äôt before helping my friend Debbie. I didn‚Äôt let on‚Ä¶too much‚Ä¶on how overwhelmingly happy it made Me to help her. Can I keep her?  I‚Äôd like to be her personal ‚Äúeyes‚Äù for real! If that‚Äôs a thing y‚Äôall do?? Hook us up please? If she‚Äôs amicable to the idea of course!! Thank you for one of the ‚Äútimes of My life!‚Äù Sincerely, Linda Jackson"
"I love the idea of this app and I love that there‚Äôs people out there needing help and they can get this app and then have help. It‚Äôs a fantastic app which is why I gave it 4 stars.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because when you do receive a call if you don‚Äôt answer quick enough it goes to another person. For instance I just had mine ring and it rang for literally one second and I answered and it said ‚Äúsomeone else has answered this call‚Äù which is disappointing because I was so excited."
"I‚Äôve had the app for about 6 months and calls don‚Äôt come through very often. I think I‚Äôve only had one other call that I couldn‚Äôt answer because I was working. Today was the first time I could actually answer a call and the call was from a man who needed help sorting through his mail. I was kind of nervous but he was very sweet, super patient, and thanked me profusely. I highly recommend downloading the app. It‚Äôs really simple but it could make someone‚Äôs day like it did mine. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I've had this app for a little over 2 years now and it's wonderful. The concept is fantastic, the interface is fault-proof, and it's very simple to use. It's even better when the person you're talking to is actually interested in having a brief conversation. But sometimes that's not the case, and that's totally okay- we all have busy lives. Easy to stop what you're doing for a few minutes to help. No excuse not to have this app! Everyone should get it and help. Thank you for creating this!"
"I don't need more pressure. That's why this is perfect for me. I don't have to worry about not picking up if I am at work or just don't feel energetic enough to answer. The call just goes to the next person after a few rings. 

Also I don't get more requests than I can handle, since there are so many of us volunteering. Another thing that works for me is that when I do help it typically only takes a few minutes. 

Such an easy way to contribute. I would never be able to volunteer otherwise. Brilliant idea. 

Just having the app and knowing it's there makes me happy because this is the kind of spirit that makes the human world great. We need these reminders that our collective human spirit is expansive, imaginative, collaborative, and can be gently beautiful."
"Not only have I been an assistant to my local blind/visually impaired community for the last 30 years, my clients have turned me on to this wonderful application. 

My clients have always contacted me via Skype or FaceTime to help them and it was always with consideration when I was free. This application allows them, as well as over 100,000 others, the opportunity to call when they need it for small or big needs. 

It‚Äôs truly a blessing to have my own sight yet it‚Äôs even more rewarding helping others, who otherwise, wouldn‚Äôt have help at all. 

Encourage those who have kindness in their hearts to use this application‚Äîit allows independence and privacy for those who need it most!

And a big thank you to the developers of this application. You have opened a world of independence for those who need it as well as satisfaction who can help."
I love the concept of the app ! I‚Äôve helped about two people so far since I‚Äôve had the app but it‚Äôs very frustrating when you don‚Äôt make it easier for people to answer . I can‚Äôt even answer it on time because I have to unlock my phone & by the time I do that it‚Äôs being passed onto someone else which is a huge disappointment especially when you look forward to answering & helping others . So please fix that ! It should be easy to answer as if it were FaceTime or even Facebook FaceTime .
"I absolutely love being able to help those in need whenever they need it. This app makes those connections so easy and so quick it‚Äôs hard not to download it. I‚Äôve been a member for 3 years and have only answered 2 calls, but those two calls have made not only a difference in their lives, but they make my life that much more fulfilled as well. I love having this app and being able to connect easily with people of all kinds who just need an extra set of eyes."
"I just downloaded this app yesterday after a friend posted it via his IG story. Got my first call today and wow!!!!!! It feels great to be able to help someone who needs help! Such an innovative way to contribute your time and help other while being in the comfort of your home. love the fact that it‚Äôs mobile so it‚Äôs easily accessible. 

I highly recommend this app/organization. I would love to see this program implemented in other ways such as helping someone deaf communicate with people, or to chat with the elderly as I know family members are too busy to call and they can get lonely. etc. 

I had a lovely conversation with nick who recommended me places to visit, talked about how a place used to be during his time etc. wow what a great talk. I LoVe this app! 

Thank you to the creators! Much love from Hawaii"
"I love to help people, this app is amazing. I‚Äôve had 5 calls and answered 3. If you can‚Äôt answer that‚Äôs okay there‚Äôs 1,000s of other people that will be called in line after you until call is picked up. You can even turn the other phones light on so YOU can see what person is asking about. Very kind people. Could be a quick 1 minuet what color is this to a long heartfelt conversation. I love this app and it‚Äôs members. Hands down üîü out of üîü"
"Every time I‚Äôve received a call I was driving, but this time I was actually stationary and ready to help! As long as you can verbally explain things in detail and not come off condescending and love to help people, download the app! I get a call maybe once every few months. So don‚Äôt expect to be a call center for the vision impaired, because calls are few and far. There are over 2 million helpers and 124k blind users with the app. So you can understand the delays."
"Not only is this app great for anyone who suffers from blindness or visual disabilities, it‚Äôs great for the volunteers too. It fills my heart whenever IÔ∏è help someone, whether it be with mail, picking out an outfit, or other daily things.  I‚Äôve seen plenty of bad reviews saying they‚Äôve never gotten any calls, but it took me over 3 months to get my very first call.  It takes time because there are over 1 million volunteers and less than 100,000 blind people.  You‚Äôre not going to get calls everyday!!"
"So be aware that you will not get calls with any amount of frequency.  There are WAY more helpers than people that need help. And that (ultimately) is a good thing.  The tasks I‚Äôve been asked to do have all been simple, no one is asking you to do their taxes or anything.  Be patient, they can‚Äôt see so the camera might need to be adjusted.  They might not be able to hang up, they also might not know you‚Äôve picked up the call.  Say hello first."
"this app is truly amazing and has a great purpose, but it gives me too much anxiety to function. a very nice man asked me to translate a password for him to get into some sort of program, and he did everything he should have and could have done. i just get too afraid and anxious to be able to properly help, i think i get scared because i know subconsciously that these people can‚Äôt help they‚Äôre blind and struggle so much because of it and that thought is too much for me to bear. if i could go back i would‚Äôve helped him out better because he deserved so much more than me, and for anyone who has that type of anxiety towards these situations please don‚Äôt download it because someone who can help will happily do the job for you, it‚Äôs okay to not be able to help out sometimes, just remember that :)"
"I ran across this app through a Facebook post. It was super easy to set up and sign in. I was concerned about ‚Äúdoing it correctly‚Äù when I received a request but the app shows you how you will be notified as well as what to do next! I got my first request while preparing for dinner. All he needed was checking mail. Simple act, he was happy, I was happy and we both continued our day. If you‚Äôre even considering using this app, please do. You won‚Äôt regret it."
"I am so happy that I came across this app. I have only answered a few calls but just knowing that I helped make someone‚Äôs day a little easier is such a rewarding feeling. I have a blind cousin so I know the hurdles they cross each and every day. God has blessed me in many ways, so helping others just seems like the right thing to do. Thank you Be My Eyes for letting me be a part of your wonderful app. Debra Baldwin Coffeyville, Kansas"
"I downloaded be my eyes a couple years ago with zero expectations. I have some vision issues and have been told I will eventually go blind, so I figured I would help while I could. It started very slow, maybe 2 calls the first year. Now I average a call per month. These calls have ranged from helping with outfits, reading bills, and my favorite, a positive pregnancy test. Be my eyes has been such a reward and blessing for me!"
"It‚Äôs the little things that mean so much to those who are less fortunate. It‚Äôs so easy and it‚Äôs beneficial for both sides! Such a satisfying feeling knowing you can help someone through the phone! I highly recommend, it doesn‚Äôt take up any time, I downloaded it, leave it active, even if you‚Äôre just chillin at the park or something, & if they call they call, if they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt! But what‚Äôs wrong with a little help and being the helper! :) love this app, such a beautiful purpose.
-Yessica Contreras"
I downloaded Be My Eyes about a month ago and I just had my first call this morning. It lasted about a minute but I was shocked at how great it felt to help someone with a task most of us take for granted. The gentleman on the call was trying to take an allergy medication and I needed to let him know which box was the correct one. The video quality was excellent and I had no issues helping grab the correct box. I hope I get more calls! It's great to see modern technology used for good!
"I have helped people coordinate their outfits and others determine if their vacuums were still charging. The most heartwarming was helping a gentleman read his mail. I learned it was his birthday and was able to join the chorus of those who used the opportunity to make him smile and tell him how kind he is. If you‚Äôre looking for a quick and easy way to be of service to others, consider downloading this app today. It‚Äôs a joy to receive a call!"
"I just got my first call and although I struggled a bit to understand how exactly the app works I was finally able to focus the camera in on the piece of mail the lady had received and read to her exactly what it was she needed to know. So I‚Äôd say it was a success! I was nervous upon answering the call but felt extremely touched by the short but moving phone call. I really enjoyed lending my eyes, I can‚Äôt wait for my next call! Very inspirational experience, very great service this app offers!!"
"I‚Äôve been able to answer two calls and help to the best of my ability! Both individuals were super sweet and we chatted for a bit also during the call. I love being able to take something that I take for granted most days and use that to help others live more independent lives. And for everyone giving 1 stars because they haven‚Äôt gotten any calls, look at the blind to volunteer ratio!"
"I made my first call for assistance today, and it was wonderful!  I needed help reading the directions for something I wanted to cook for dinner, and the lady who answered was very nice and did a great job!  I didn‚Äôt have the camera lined up quite right, but she helped me adjust it.  It only took a minute or so, but it was a big help to me!  It‚Äôs nice not to have to ‚Äúbother‚Äù friends and family for help so much.  Thank you for this great app!!!"
"I recently downloaded this app to volunteer and it‚Äôs great! I got my first notification today and there is no pressure to answer if you are unable to, but luckily I was available and the first to take the call! I was on my call for probably less than a minute, but it felt great to know that I made a difference in this person‚Äôs day. There is barely any commitment and it will not get in the way of your day at all, but it will make the day much easier for somebody else."
"I got my first call today. I was able to help a lovely woman pick out an outfit for her son to wear to church! My boyfriend was with me and he was so impressed by the app that he decided to download it too!

Edit- I brought it down to 4 stars because the call notification is sooo easy to miss. Out of the 9 calls we have received, we have missed 7.. it is so upsetting because I would really have loved to help. Please please please allow us to choose a louder call notification setting.. vibration would be an added bonus!"
"I am visually impaired and I use this app almost every day to help me match clothes, read screens and so much more. This app has made my life so much easier because I live in a house by myself with my guy dogs but sometimes I just need a little help adjusting my thermostat or finding the right pair of work clothes in the morning. I definitely would recommend this app to any blind user or even any cited user to be a volunteer."
"My blind uncle told me he used this app to help him. He recently passed away and it reminded me to install it, and I'm glad I did. I just helped someone with their dinner, they wanted to know what canned goods they had.

To think that without this app someone would have tried to make dinner and would have had to open cans at random. Now as I type this a blind man is eating the dinner he wanted to prepare, not eat what he accidentally opened.

Thanks for telling me about this app, Dan. I love and miss you!"
"I got a call, several months, after downloading the app.

She had an old fashioned thermometer and couldn‚Äôt read it. Those are awful to read in person, I couldn‚Äôt help (feel awful about it).  I couldn‚Äôt see it well enough to read. üòî But, the system worked just the way it was supposed to - connected a visually impaired person with someone sighted. (She‚Äôd had a feeling it might not work over the video, but was worth trying)"
"I am a sighted person and I absolutely love this app.  It doesn‚Äôt constantly harass you or run ads, but if someone needs help it is super easy to answer a call.  The five interactions I have had have all been super brief and left me feeling great.  Awesome to be able to do random anonymous acts of kindness.  Everyone at the small brewery where I work has now downloaded the app and they love it too!  Great idea, good execution, and I highly recommended being a sighted volunteer."
"I cannot tell you what a gift being a part of this has been for me. I have been a volunteer since March of 2020 and I believe have answered 5 or 6 calls to date. Every single time it is the most rewarding experience. The gratitude from the callers is evident, but I have to say, the gratitude is all mine. I am lucky to have to opportunity to be a part of something so amazing and I ‚Äúsee‚Äù how together we can really be successful."
"Absolutely fantastic idea and execution to help visually impaired folks. Take the time and donate a few minutes to answer a call for someone trying to figure something out. Whether it be sorting canned food, logging into their computer, asking which milk is expired, use your power of vision to help those in need. Every call I‚Äôve answered has been some of the most wholesome conversations.

Do yourself a favor, and help out and install this app."
I know I didn‚Äôt put a title on this but yeah I will give this app six stlars if that was a thing and fact 6 1/2 stars if that was a thing because it‚Äôs it seems to be like a really good helpful app and I know I‚Äôll be using it a lot at school when I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to do something when I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to cook something read something right something I know just be helpful in general
"I love helping people and stumbled upon this app when looking up ways to volunteer. The idea behind this really caught my attention, but I was a bit skeptical about how it worked. It was until I got my first call the third day of having this app. I helped a mother read letters on a medical tube of some sort. Although it took some time to get the camera positioned correctly with such small font, she ended up getting the help she needed! Made my day."
This is such an amazing app and concept and now that I‚Äôve taken my first call and helped someone I‚Äôm hooked this is such a great way for visually impaired people to get quick and simple help for any day to day task.  & from a helper POV : I LOVE helping with anything that I can so being able to have this app where someone who needs visual assistance can easily reach out and ask questions and get the help they need is so fascinating .
"The only reason this app is effective as it is is that the number of volunteers SIGNIFICANTLY outnumber those who are blind or low sighted. I've only answered a couple of calls and I've been on this app for around a year. Even if you have an open schedule you won't be constantly bombarded with calls, as I actually will leave class just to answer one. Everyone I have met has been the absolute nicest, and I love making someone's life a little easier."
"I never rate apps, but this one deserves praise! I just signed up for the app as a volunteer last night. I thought it would probably be a while before I received a call for help, but I just got my first one. The interface was so easy to use & it was really cool to be able to help someone by using a sense that I somewhat take for granted daily. I hope to be able to help more people on a regular basis. Thanks for giving us an opportunity to help! Great app!!"
My first call I was actually scrolling Facebook on my phone and was so thrilled I tapped away! The dear sweet lady was needing help identifying cleaning products. It is such amazing technology and I praise the person/people that thought of this! I told my office mate about this app her son is visually impaired we discussed that it's a comfort knowing that when he is older there will be not only be amazing technology as this but possibly more advanced technology to help him live more independently!
"I‚Äôm a volunteer and have been for quite a while. It‚Äôs such a blessing to be able to help someone else be independent. The calls truly are to aid someone else be able to do things or find things on their own. It‚Äôs as simple as reading what type of vegetable is in a can or seeing if batteries were installed correctly. I can say this enough, this is an awesome experience and a joy to take part in."
"24 hours ago I signed up to volunteer. My sister is blind and has been for about 10 years. She uses this app when she goes to the grocery store and has found that everyone who volunteers to take her call for help, have been extremely nice and friendly. 
As she says, for someone with sight, it doesn‚Äôt seem like much to help someone who is blind. But for someone who is blind, it means the world to them.

Thank you for creating this amazing app!"
"I love the option to turn on the caller‚Äôs flashlight.  It‚Äôs very helpful for those of us who accommodate ourselves with lamps and overhead lights!  
I wish I knew whether it automatically shuts off again when the call ends...?  That‚Äôs been bugging me because it can really zap a person‚Äôs battery if they don‚Äôt realize the torch is still on.  Does it shut off again?"
This is a great app to help people. I‚Äôve helped people with putting a channel on a tv and other things. So far so good. The only reason why I‚Äôm giving it three stars was because I just got a call from a women and went ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù and the man next to her was very aggressive saying ‚ÄúSpeak to her!! Comon ask how your day was and how your doing!‚Äù And obviously I was like woah but didn‚Äôt say a word. The service cut out and she ended the call. This app can be weird sometimes. The app is to help you see not to talk and ask how my day was.
"This is fantastic. It really does give blind and visually impaired people the assistance they need. I‚Äôve had it for several months but never had the need to use it, but today I did. Wow, what an amazing thing. The only thing is though if you don‚Äôt know how to change front rear facing to front facing camera on your phone it can be a little challenging. But this is so cool, I highly recommend it. It is easy to use and it works fantastically well. Thanks to the creators"
"I am sighted. I LOVE that I can volunteer and help someone, while I‚Äôm in my pajamas at home! This app brings me joy. I have helped some one find lost remote, identified boxes in a freezer, helped dye a wig/beard for a Halloween costume, helped match colors of clothes for an interview. Helped someone know which part of a box was the top, & many other adventures. I just wish I was sent more calls! Get this app; it really makes your day! üòä"
"I‚Äôve helped someone set the right temperature on their oven; determine what color the shirt on the hanger was, and provide movie start times from a video screen that weren‚Äôt audible.

Quick and easy each time, and if I were sight impaired I could see this being a great help to know there are thousands of US out here willing to ‚ÄúBe My Eyes.‚Äù

Appropriate technology and use of crowd sourcing if there ever was one."
"This app is amazing. I liked the idea of this app and how it works. I also love to help the special people with their problems. I only disliked the quality of the call. I had a caller today, and the call was disconnected due to unknown problem. I was able to hear the caller but it was really slow and laggy. I felt bad because I did not help him. I hope you guys can fix this problem."
got my first call within a day of downloading the app. it‚Äôs only been 1.5 months and I‚Äôve had two calls total. Both were great and I actually had the opportunity to chat with the second user for a while after I assisted them and it was very heartwarming for the both of us. would totally recommend for both seeing and visually impaired people. five stars for sure!
"I had my first call today and the experience was wonderful. Just the feeling that you can help someone just by over the phone, the little stuff we take for granted is just a life changing experience when you can help someone with a daily task that we look at as a complaint. I‚Äôm glad a friend of mind told me about this app, looking forward to help more people with any more daily living. I recommend this app."
"Hello there. I have been using this app for a long time, and I love it. However, when I go to make a call, voiceover becomes very quiet as soon as I double tap ‚Äúcall first available helper ‚Äúvoiceover remains quiet until I go to the home screen. Before I go to the home screen, I have to literally put my phone up to my ear to hear what voiceover is saying. The audio of the volunteer is good, however. Please fix this bug. Thank you very much. Please keep up the good work. :-)"
"It‚Äôs a great idea but I never get any calls (1-2 per week).I think they should make a setting so that people with the app open to a certain space will be routed to a call and if not enough people have their apps open, they can go to the current system. There are a lot of benefits to this including faster response times, volunteers won‚Äôt complain about no calls, and the people who pick up
Will be in a more intentional environment."
I‚Äôve never been one for volunteering for things. But when I heard about this app I downloaded it strictly out of curiosity for how it works. And just a few days later I got my first call. And it was incredible. There are a lot more volunteers on this app than there are ppl who need it so I quickly jumped at the opportunity to get on the line. And after ‚Äúbeing someone else‚Äôs eyes‚Äù for the first time I‚Äôm hooked. It was awesome. This was an amazing idea.
"I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking into it. I have been called 2x and missed the first. Second was cut short due to technical issues with his phone but we spoke for about 5 min. We were retracing his steps to look for something he dropped. We were 5 min into a 15 min walk. Super fun and what amazed me was how thankful he was, yet how happy I was to help."
"I love this app. I rarely get calls but I have been lucky enough to answer a few in the past few years. Although I get so upset when I miss a call (because it‚Äôs exciting to answer and be able to help when I can), it makes me happy that I don‚Äôt get them so often! It just means that there are that many other people who are available and willing to help."
"I love helping people with Be My Eyes.  I‚Äôve had multiple eye surgeries and am so grateful to be able to see with glasses. This is my way of expressing my gratitude. 
For some reason, this app automatically logs me out all the time, and does not allow me to save my password.  So when I get a request for help, I have to log back in, and/or reset my password; and by the time I do that, someone else is already answering the call.  It‚Äôs great that users get help immediately, but it‚Äôs frustrating not to be able to provide assistance immediately!"
"If you‚Äôre like me, you find yourself trying to find ways to help others without drawing attention to yourself. It‚Äôs about the giving, not the accolades for giving. 

Be My Eyes allows me to spend a few minutes helping someone. Sometimes people just need a tiny bit of help. I helped a woman this week determine whether the light in a room was on or off. Simple. Helpful. 

I strongly encourage people to participate!"
I‚Äôve had the app since November and I‚Äôve only had a couple of calls so it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre constantly getting calls from people so it‚Äôs nice to have. I think this app was such an amazing idea and I love helping people even if it‚Äôs something super small. I‚Äôm happy I get the chance to help people out that I never thought I‚Äôd connect with because it‚Äôs people all over the world .
"I am a volunteer and I love this app. I‚Äôve only gotten one call but I was so happy to help. I had a very sweet lady needing me to help her separate things by color. I am disappointed by the amount of negative reviews on not getting any calls. As of right now, there are over 2,000,000 volunteers and only 126,000 people in need of help. Just be patient! If you don‚Äôt have the patience to wait for a call before complaining, you shouldn‚Äôt have the app."
As a sighted volunteer I really like the ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù app. I feel like I‚Äôm making a positive impact by helping the visually impaired. I hope the app continues to make updates because sometimes the other persons video is not as clear and makes it harder to provide assistance. I also think for feedback there should be 2 questions - first about the call quality with the person & 2nd about the technological quality. Overall very awesome experience
"To the individuals who created this app, thank you! I downloaded it yesterday and just received my first call tonight! I was helping someone adjust their sleep apnea machine, they were so kind and grateful! Being able to help someone is hands down the best feeling ever. I love the ‚Äúflashlight‚Äù button on the call, it helped immensely! I love this app and have told several people about it already."
"I am not available to answer all the time, but the one time I was actually able to answer a call in almost a year, it didn‚Äôt work. The caller said he was switching some mode or something right after we said hi, and it froze after that, so I wasn‚Äôt able to help. Disappointing and frustrating. 
There were a few other calls that even tho I thought I answered immediately, said that they were already answered. How does that work? Do they ring a whole bunch of people at the same time and fastest answerer gets the call?
I still love the idea of this app and will keep it."
"I‚Äôm grateful there is an app out there where those who are visually impaired can get help with tasks the rest of us take for granted. From helping change a thermostat temperature to pulling ground beef out of the freezer. It‚Äôs a beautiful idea that someone just calls and gets the help they need, and it takes almost no time out of both our days. I love this app. Everyone should download it."
"What a marvelous idea! I‚Äôm blind, and though I‚Äôm very independent, I struggle with situations that aren‚Äôt issues for fully sighted people. For example, I frequently misplace things ‚Äî often just out of reach. After groping around, often on hands & knees on the floor, I give up in frustration. With ‚ÄúBe My Eyes,‚Äù I get immediate assistance locating dropped or misplaced items. Thank you so much for this very clever and handy app!"
"I‚Äôm a volunteer here, and I have had the opportunity to help one of the members. She needed assistance with the instructions on a package of prepared food. A small task, sure, but one that I suspect is very frustrating for many people without sight or with limited sight. The Be My Eyes interface was intuitive and the communication was smooth. It made it very easy for me to assist this young woman and perform my mitzvah for the day. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity."
"I‚Äôve had this app for quite a while now. I‚Äôve had a few call but either missed them, or someone else got to the call first. Today I happened to be using my phone when a call came though and was able to promptly take the call. It was nice to be able to help someone and make their life just a little easier."
"I joined yesterday and I just got my first call. The experience was really great and the app worked just fine. The only thing I would remark on is sharpening the camera so it's easier to see smaller words but other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about the functionality. Honestly, I'm so glad an application like this exists and I'm very happy to be apart of it."
"I met a frustrated woman today on the app because the connection was poor and the camera was blurry. I have met friendly people on this app and it warms my heart to help, but some people aren‚Äôt all that way and unfortunately couldn‚Äôt be assisted because the camera quality was blurry. I was at home on great wifi so I know I didn‚Äôt have the issue. I think the app creators need to work on making the connectivity less blurry as that is the main reason/tool for the app."
"As a volunteer on this app, it is so rewarding to help others who need it - it‚Äôs super simple and I wish there was a call back ability because sometimes I can‚Äôt answer if I am working or somewhere where I can‚Äôt hear. I also wish I could get called more often, I would love to help. What a wonderful idea this app is. Simple to figure out and use as a volunteer."
"I‚Äôve gotten probably 5 calls in the year I‚Äôve had the app but if you aren‚Äôt fast, someone else will answer! Today I was quick enough to answer and I helped someone get their movie back on after the remote had fallen and changed the channel. Such a humbling experience. So glad something like this is available for these people and so awesome anyone can volunteer to help. Highly recommend. Made my day!"
"I read the description and was immediately skeptical. I started thinking about it though, and I realized its just brilliant. Absolutely brilliant - through and through. It‚Äôs amazing to see someones good intentions follow through THIS HARD. Y'all went OFF with this app. Great job, such a usable interface, amazing people. Triple threat. I bet you guys didn‚Äôt lose a single dollar with this idea. Thank you for letting others help others! What a selfless idea üíï"
"As happy volunteer I‚Äôm always looking to give more ! It‚Äôs so fulfilling and give light to my heart to be at the service of someone else ! But there is always that lack of me thinking I can give or do more !
This app is phenomenal because I can be able to help anyone at any time not just in certain days a week . 
I know I can help someone in other part of the world and make the feel my support! 
Thanks you"
"I‚Äôm a bit of a humanist and I love helping people. When I logged into the App Store and saw the Be My Eyes app, I knew I had o download it and become a volunteer. When someone needs help the call comes in as a notification and connects to the other person ONLY if you open the notification. It‚Äôs such an easy way to help. The app is very easy to use and I highly recommend it. It feels great to help people and share a human connection."
"I‚Äôm a volunteer here and I have answered a call before. It is super rewarding and I absolutely love it. The only downside is that in the few months I‚Äôve had the app, I‚Äôve only received three calls. The call goes out to several volunteers so you gotta be quick but you know that if you can‚Äôt answer, someone will. I love this and encourage all impaired people to download this app and use it and I urge all sighted people to download and become a volunteer."
"This app is wonderful, and shows how far technology has come. I am a home health aid and truly feel that my purpose in life is to help others. This app allows me to do so much to improve the quality of life for members of the visually impaired community all over the world! I highly recommend downloading the app! My heart feels so full from the experiences I have had!"
Really interesting service. Makes me excited to use it. I haven‚Äôt been able to help anyone yet though because of the disproportionate amount of volunteers to blind people. Almost 10 to 1. I‚Äôve received 3 calls but I‚Äôve never been fast enough to answer them. Makes my heart jump every time though. I‚Äôve drop things I never thought I would drop to try to answer the call.
"After 9 months of having the app, I finally was able to help someone with their situation.  She wanted the brand name of a body mist and the amount.  After a about a minute and a half of turning the bottle in front of the camera and getting it centered so I could read it, I was able to provide the assistance the very nice woman needed.  If you want to help people and feel good doing it, download this app!"
"This app is, to me, the highest use of Internet technology that exists right now. It works well and I am thrilled to be a part of the ‚Äúhelper‚Äù community they have built. Thanks for making this brilliant public service happen!
I have a number of stories of my own experiences with the app, but will simply say that a moment of my sight is now a tremendously valuable gift I can easily give. I get as big a lift as the people I am able to assist."
"I have been able to assist 2 callers over the past year. Having 2 deaf siblings I am very aware of limitations for persons with disabilities. It can be very frustrating for them at times and not always easy to ask for help, but when they do we need to listen and help. So, I am very happy there is this service for the blind and happy to help when I can."
"First of all, what an amazing app to create I order to love the blind well and help them live their lives!!! Such a caring mindset around this app, it‚Äôs astounding. I am a seeing volunteer and got my first call today and it was incredible!! I take seeing for granted- and this app helps me use my sight for good and hopefully bring others a small amount of peace in the aid of their disabilityü•∞ literally love this so much"
I‚Äôm so happy there‚Äôs an app where I can help people when they need it. It makes me feel good when I actually help people out on this app. I helped a blind man with his microwave the other day and he was so happy that I was patient enough to help him. Sometimes it can be difficult because the camera isn‚Äôt clear enough but over all it‚Äôs just a blessing to be apart of this.
"Got my first call today... was having a bad day after talking to someone who is having a hard time with just doing common things it made he feel better ... being a service to someone else!
I told other family members about the app as well. We can definitely be of service to others during this hard time."
"I got this app a while back but had not used it before today because some other sighted person answered the call faster than I did. Today I helped a blind someone read something and it was cool to help. You can even turn on the light on their phone if you need it to see better.
Because there are so many sighted people signed up, you don't get s call but once every few months."
Whoo so i have a lot to say. First of all im eleven so the fact that im doing this is pretty amazing. 2 i came from a meme. Yes. We‚Äôre locked in our homes roght now and i just want a way to help. (not like I could do much outside because of my age but still) and im excited to help blind people and want to see their reactions for my age. Sorry if things here are grammatically wrong.
"We‚Äôve gotten two calls from people needing help reading their medication bottles. The information is blurred out each time. I‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs a privacy thing. Not sure if the issue is through FaceTime or the app itself, but it‚Äôs kind of a big deal. Obviously the people need help reading it, we‚Äôre volunteering to help. I could care less about their medical information."
"This is a great cause. I‚Äôm really excited to receive my first call, and I hope it‚Äôs at a time when I can see it and am able to take it. You guys deserve all the support that such a noble cause as this warrants. 5 stars because this is amazing, and because regardless of whether or not I‚Äôve gotten to try my first experience on your app, you guys deserve the recognition!"
This is a great app. Very easy to use and so rewarding for both the volunteer and the blind person needing a little help. Just takes a quick moment to use. Only downside is that there are not enough calls and they are hard to get. This is due to difference in # of volunteers and blind people. We need to encourage more people to sign up!
"I downloaded the app back in July of last year after I read an article about the app helping out visually impaired people and whom  I have had the pleasure of assisting. I kinda feel bad that I haven‚Äôt answered as much calls as some people, but still grateful to help out those that need my help. Thank you ‚ÄòBe My Eyes‚Äô for such a wonderful app!!"
"Once I shook off that deep-seated feeling that I'm bothering people by needing help, this app proved to be exceptional. While I frequently use all manner of text, item, money, and barcode recognizers, sometimes I really just need a good pair of eyes. The volunteers seem quite the opposite of bothered, always enthusiastic to have someone to help, and it's reliably found me someone in under a minute each time. 10/10: thrilled."
I work for an Ophthalmologist. This is an incredible app with a lot of potential. I downloaded the app yesterday and got my first call today. I went to accept it but it was too late. There is just not enough time to accept a call. My heart was racing I was so excited to answer the call and then it was gone. Wish I could have helped.
"This app along with all the people who volunteer to be my eyes, has significantly changed my life. No more depending on family or friends to stop by for help for simple things like, (Can you read these cooking instructions?) or(What color is this dress or these shoes?) or(Can you help me find something I dropped on the floor,?). The list is endless, don't know how I got along without it."
"First time, I was able to help someone out. All he wanted was to ask me to see the charging level of his power bank. Because he was blind, I was able to help directing him to point the camera at the indicator.  Just a small act of kindness but it made me happy that I could help. 

The app is very easy to use. I love the people who thought of this. Let‚Äôs change the world positively, a little at a time."
"I absolutely love this app. Whenever I get a notification that someone needs me to be their eyes I jump up with joy! 

My father is partial blind so for the past 10 years everybody in my family has been his eyes whenever he can‚Äôt see well. Then, I found this app that makes it possible to not only help one person, but everyone who needs it! 

Love love love! My honors to the founder!"
"I‚Äôve been a sighted volunteer on Be My Eyes for a year now and have helped a sweet elderly woman pick out colors of thread for a gift she was making, a man complete inventory in a small grocery store, a group of teenagers select chip flavors, and a woman set her oven to bake something at the right temperature. It is such a blessing to be able to help others! The idea is fantastic and app execution is flawless. Excited to be a small part of something big."
"I loved the idea of this application. It‚Äôs proved a great opportunity to help others. 
After using this app for several months, I realised that many of users used it for other purposes. So far I received four calls from different users, I can tell all of them are not blind because they asked silly questions about things they know all the details about.
Do not risk your privacy and don‚Äôt waste your time by using this fake app. I‚Äôm not against helping people in need, but this app is a joke. Try to find another ways to help people without risking your privacy."
"Not only does a sighted person have the opportunity to assist others with tasks and activities for which sight is an asset or necessity, but you get to meet and hear stories of incredible people. This app brilliantly brings together those able and willing to assist, and those who need a few minutes of assistance to support independence and safety. I love this so much!!"
I signed up last night and got my first call this afternoon. It was a lady trying to make chicken for her family who was out of the house. I was able to assist to get her to figure out the oven. It took 5 minutes of my time but I felt like a million bucks helping. She was so thankful. Excellent app. Easy to use and wildly helpful to those that need it.
"I‚Äôve only gotten one call before but wasn‚Äôt able to answer because I was in church at the time, I‚Äôve had this app for months to almost a year, I love the idea of this app and the amount of help it gives to people in need, I just wish I got more calls so that I‚Äôm able to help people as that is the reason I got this app."
This app is so fantastic and I am so happy to be able to be of service to the blind users of this app. My father and grandfather have both passed and had degenerative eye diseases that rendered them blind so this is especially dear to my heart. I have only received one call but it was so heart warming and this is just a genius way to help people all over the world. I hope to get many many more calls! Thank you.
"I have been a volunteer for several years and love this app! I have four little ones so time serving others outside my home is reduced. This app gives me a unique opportunity to love others in a small, simple way. Each time I have responded to a call has been such a bright spot in my day. I signed up to be a blessing to others, but I feel like I am the one who is blessed."
"I love knowing that I can share my sight with those who have low- or no vision. I‚Äôve assisted folks asking what vitamin bottle or food can they held, what the buttons on the new radio does, and how much cash they were holding. It makes me very happy to be able to share my sight with those who need assistance. What an absolutely genius idea for an app and I finally see some good in owning a smart phone!"
Something like this should be recommended by doctors etc. I just imagine my grandfather who was blind 40 years having something like this. This is definitely innovative and the most humbling app I have ever used! I enjoy helping those in need. Such small things have the biggest impacts! Definitely makes my day when I get a call!
"I signed up a few months ago and a month later I got my first call. I was really excited. But once the guy started talking to me, it felt more like a scam. He was talking about how he had hardly any money and didn‚Äôt know what to do. And he kept talking about it to the point it seemed like he wanted me to send him money. And he was walking around a park and he seemed to know where he was going while he was walking around. There would be things in the way and he would walk over them without using a walking stick. Like he could see... the whole encounter felt odd"
I‚Äôm a volunteer and have received a handful of calls over the last year. A few I missed because I wasn‚Äôt near my phone but each call I have answered I‚Äôve been able to help out with finding things and just making life a bit easier for people who are vision impaired. It‚Äôs a great passive way to volunteer a small part of my time whenever the opportunity arises.
Just had my first call and it was so easy. It connected almost immediately and the video quality seemed better than most facetime calls. Spent a couple of minutes with my caller helping him set up his tv then was able to get back to my day. This is a fantastic app not only idea but in execution. I‚Äôll be happy to answer calls whenever I‚Äôm able.
"I‚Äôve been signed up to help for three months and got my first chance to help early this morning. It was a little earlier than I would have expected (4:30 AM), but I was experiencing jet lag and was surprised and excited to get the call. I was able to help the blind participant navigate some settings on his phone. He was very appreciative and I was very grateful to help. Thank you for creating this app."
"I can finally write one about this app as I just had the absolute pleasure of answering my first call. I got to help a lovely lady named Donna. She made my day better instantly. 

I cannot put into words how amazing this app is on the volunteer side. Helping someone and knowing its instantly making their lives easier is truly a gratifying experience.

This is one app I will never delete, ever."
"The person helping describe my router did a great job of telling me what I needed to know, including which way to move the camera and being patient with my questions.  Said it was her 1st call, too.  I'm not used to turning the light on, so it'll be interesting to see if I actually develop a habit of checking whether I've turned lights off."
When I downloaded the app it changed my life forever my anger issues has gone and my depression has Ben gone my relationship with my brother are getting better and better because we always fight and when I got my first call I got joy and was filled with excitement I love the app I wish there was a donation button to give for the blind people that would be cool
"The ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù app was brought to my attention by a family member in Chicago. I signed up the next day, and got my first call about a month later. I was very happy and excited to get a call from a woman needing help matching socks. I was so thrilled to help, and I hope that I did a good job! Be My Eyes is a wonderful app, and I‚Äôm looking forward to my next call!"
I think this is a great service for those who can‚Äôt see. I‚Äôve only received 2 phone calls and they both went well. One took a little longer than the other and was a little more difficult than the other (helping the gentleman walk from one place to another in downtown Atlanta!). I am happy to help and I hope more people who need help discover this app.
"Months back, I put this application on my iPod touch fifth-generation.
Since then, I‚Äôve been recommending be my eyes to folks who are friends and family. Keep up the great work, and also keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. This helps a lot of us who are visually impaired. I also hope that you get lots of volunteers to help with the service. You‚Äôre doing something wonderful."
"Signed on as a helper. Just completed my first call and helped a gentleman from Indiana get a phone number off a business card...but had the wrong card! We chatted for a few minutes and I was able to look up the number on my computer (He said switching between apps on your phone will drop the call fyi!) 

Can‚Äôt wait to do it again."
I volunteer with Be My Eyes to pay kindness forward. My brother is legally blind and I know every interaction he has with helpers makes a difference in his life. The app is very simple and stays on mission to connect blind and sight impaired users with volunteers to solve one little issue at a time. You are literally the eyes for someone at that particular moment. The longest call I received was prolly 6 min. The shortest about 20 seconds.
"I got my first call today!  Now I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!  It took 5 days for my first call, hope I don‚Äôt have to wait another 5 days. The call was super easy and I felt totally secure that they couldn‚Äôt see or locate me. It felt so great to tell the man on the other side what the box was he was holding. That was it!  10 seconds and my day was made!  Love this app!"
Today I was able to answer my first call. I feel very lucky to have been the first of over 5 million volunteers to respond. My heart is overflowing with joy to have had a chance to help someone. Congratulations on an extraordinary program. Thank you to my daughter and son-in-law for teaching me about this program. I am in awe.
I love ideas like this. I signed up several months ago and have only got an alert a handful of times and usually someone else beats me to it but one time I actually got to answer the call. It was someone who simply needed to know which of his shoes he had put on. Such a quick and simple way to lend a hand to someone. I love it.
"Over the past few months I have had my phone notify me for 4 calls and other volunteers answered before I could, which is great because someone is getting help faster, but today I actually answered my 1st call. The people that invented this app have done such a wonderful thing for so many people."
"This app is life changing. It makes life so much easier to have a sighted person‚Äôs assistance at the tap of a button. I‚Äôm an independent person, but there are those times when sighted assistance is necessary. To have this available within moments is so wonderful. 

I‚Äôm a vision teacher and show this to all of my students. Students have cried at the freedom this app has given them."
Hello I‚Äôm a volunteer and I can think of a way to make this app better for the vollenters who can‚Äôt answer at times. Why not include a new feature where you can pause the app so you don‚Äôt get notifications. I can‚Äôt answer when I‚Äôm at school and knowing that there are people I could be helping when I can‚Äôt gets me unfocused and sad that I can‚Äôt help:( I would love to see this implemented in to this wonderful app! Chaio
I live alone and get frustrated when I drop something and can‚Äôt find it. Especially if it‚Äôs able to roll across the floor. Be my eyes has help me find things that drop. Now I don‚Äôt have to get frustrated anymore. I know I will be able to pick it up in short order and will not step on something to break it. This app is truly something wonderful.
"At first I didn‚Äôt get any calls. I thought it was a good idea but I didn‚Äôt get to try it so that kinda bummed me out. 
Today I got my first call! It was absolutely amazing. I simply chose an outfit for the kind man. However, it made really happy. It made my day!
Also, the connection was flawless and I also generally like the design of the app! 
This should be the future! It is revolutionary!!!"
"This review is from a helpers point of view . It‚Äôs been 4 months since I last received a call. I understand the odds should be about 1 in 17 that you receive a call , but it just seems like that is a long time between a chance to assist. It might be useful to see call stats so that people can understand the frequency (or lack there of)of calls, and understand what may be a normal ‚Äúwait‚Äù period ."
I signed up to volunteer with this app a few months ago and have been contacted twice to help someone. It‚Äôs taken less than two minutes each time and has been immensely satisfying and makes you feel great the rest of the day. We need more ideas like this. There‚Äôs no reason technology can‚Äôt make the world better for *everyone*z
"I‚Äôm one of the volunteer helpers and I love being one. I‚Äôve had a few calls where I‚Äôve helped people, and they have always been so nice and grateful that it makes me feel great to be able to help. I thought the idea of it was amazing from the start. I appreciate that calls for assistance are sent to multiple volunteer, so I know even if I‚Äôm busy, someone else will help out."
"I downloaded this app a year ago. Tonight I got a call from an elderly lady who said, ‚ÄúI just received a framed picture of my granddaughter as a gift in the mail, I wish I can see what it looks like. Can you describe what you see.‚Äù So I described and we chatted a little. So simple. It‚Äôs moment like this that remind me to stay in gratitude."
"I am a sighted volunteer and I‚Äôve had this app since August 2020. I‚Äôve only received about 3 calls since then and was able to help people with daily tasks. The app is totally free and if you‚Äôre ever unable to take a call, no worries, it can go to the next volunteer. It‚Äôs an easy way to help those with impaired vision via phone."
"I am so emotional after my first call for be my eyes. I read a lady her mail and we spent the next few minutes talking about the craziness of the world during this pandemic and how we were thankful to be safe and healthy. It‚Äôs free, you don‚Äôt get email ads or spammed with calls. But it makes a huge difference in their day AND yours!"
"I got this app hoping to be able to help people. I signed up as soon as I downloaded it. This was over a year ago. Today I got a notification from the app (didn‚Äôt want me to help anybody, just wanted to tell me some story) then I realized that I haven‚Äôt touched this app in over a year and not once did I ever get a request to help someone. 

Not like I even care anyway. Just thought I would leave this here too let people know what to expect from this app. I suppose it‚Äôs more useful for blind people than sighted people."
"You're never too busy to help with this wonderful organization. Just answer your call (if able), help the non-sighted with any questions only a sighted person could answer - and you're done! I am an endurance rider (horses) and always have my phone on me, so this is just perfect for me"
"I was finally able to answer a call in time to help somebody! Yay! Sometimes it‚Äôs tricky because there are so many volunteers willing to help out and answer their phone. 

I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to help a young lady distinguish various pie flavors from one another. It was funny because she put the ones she loved the best in a pile that she was going to have for her, and the ones she did not love in another pile for someone else. Ha ha. 

I love how there‚Äôs a system where there is a flashlight on the screen thst lights up the area on her phone. What‚Äôs fabulous experience! I would give it 10 stars if it were possible!

Cori"
I enrolled July 25 and answered my first call tonight by a sweet lady in Michigan it was 7pm Hawaiian time and she was up at around midnight looking at hallmark cards and needed help with them. While the camera was focusing we got to talking she found out I was an active duty soldier and then told me how her family also served in Hawaii. The call probably lasted about 10 minutes. It was an amazing experience to help someone and talk to someone new at the same time.
I love being able to help people by just taking a few minutes out of day. It‚Äôs really a fast and easy way to lend a helping hand to someone else. I‚Äôve even had some of the same callers which is fun because they recognize your voice and you bond over that small moment.
I volunteer with it and it‚Äôs such a neat idea. Seriously I got to take 5 minutes out of my day to help make someone else‚Äôs life a little easier. So worth it! The only think I wish would be that they‚Äôd give you an option to put whether you‚Äôre available or not so I‚Äôm not worried I‚Äôll get a call while I‚Äôm at work because I won‚Äôt really be able to answer.
I hope this app is advertised to schools for blind and as widely as possible. I got my first call yesterday and it went really well! A married couple who are both visually impaired needed my help reading some insurance cards. They were so impressed by the app service and we chatted a little bit after. This app is a great idea! Please market this great service!
"I know we have a lot more volunteers than people needing assistance. So we n Ed to be getting the word out to our visually impaired friends and community. And, if you are visually impaired, please use the app as much as you need to! There are so many of us out here who are still waiting for our first time to help someone! Trust me - we‚Äôre out here, so use the app as often as possible."
"What an incredible feeling to be able to help someone with something we take for granted every single day. I mean really, you have no reason to not download this app and help someone when it‚Äôs your turn to pick up a call.. it‚Äôs so easy and makes you feel good. Being nice is free.. so is helping the blind."
"As soon as I heard about the app Be My Eyes, I immediately downloaded it and signed up. I have now answered a handful of calls and have helped people all across the world! Since there a lot of volunteers available, calls are always answered very fast. This is such a great resource for those who are blind/visually impaired! I‚Äôm happy to be a volunteer!"
"I love that it‚Äôs anonymous and there‚Äôs no pressure to answer a call. Most of the time, it‚Äôs simply reading part of a label or identifying basic colors. It‚Äôs an easy way to help a stranger. It‚Äôs also helped me improve my communication skills. I recommend it for anyone who likes an occasional positive interruption during their free time."
"Such a fun way to help other people! The calls take literally 20 seconds to about 2 minutes, and it‚Äôs just simple tasks that are easy for sighted people but are an obstacle for the blind. I get giddy whenever a call comes through because there are so many more volunteers to users üòä"
"Living to love on people is what makes me, well me.... be my eyes is a way I can love on people - they call I help. The person who has reached out for my help requires trust in me - but what I get back is even better than the help I‚Äôve provided the person calling. I get pure joy from helping. This is the best dopamine hit you can get. Jeff"
"I finally got the opportunity to help someone yesterday and had such a nice time speaking with him. After we found the spice he was looking for, we talked about other topics and just had a nice chat. He even offered advice for my friend, whose 1 year old is visually impaired, as they begin to navigate this new world.  I hope I get the opportunity to help someone again soon!"
I don‚Äôt know if there is any feeling quite as good as being able to help someone. It definitely makes my day and week better to be able to help in any way I can. It makes the world seem smaller and more human that we all need help with things at times and there are people around the world willing and able to help. Love this app!!!!
"The community is so large and fast that I have only been able to respond quickly enough to 1 out of 15 calls.

I am a supporter who helped a young person find something dropped on the floor of their hotel room. It was a wholesome experience indeed. 

Smart app and great community."
"I‚Äôve assisted a few people now and it‚Äôs such an easy process.  They show you the problem ie ‚Äúwhat color is this‚Äù - ‚Äúwhich button is on‚Äù you answer the question, ensure there‚Äôs nothing else, bid each other goodbye.  That‚Äôs it, there‚Äôs no awkwardness- easy.  I can help someone just by answering my phone."
"It‚Äôs not an everyday thing but it completely turned a bad day all the around for me! 
I‚Äôve never found an app that not only helps the visually impaired but I feel awesome I had the chance to help someone that‚Äôs across the world!! Something so small that means so much to them and helps them get their their day!"
Too many volunteers. I‚Äôve had the app 1 year and haven‚Äôt been able to help anyone cause they send you the same call they send everyone else. Don‚Äôt matter if it takes me .2 seconds to click accept. Someone else always gets it. And idk why I even have the app anymore
"Amazing! Thank you for letting me be a part of such an incredible app. Every caller I‚Äôve had has told me how much the love it and how helpful it is. It warms my heart to help every single time. The only thing I would change is the ringer volume. It‚Äôs very quiet and I‚Äôve missed some calls because I couldn‚Äôt hear the ringer. But besides that, this is great!"
I absolutely love this app. It makes me feel so good just interacting with others. I wouldn‚Äôt even care if they called just so say what‚Äôs the weather today?! Lol. I wish more people would use it. I have spent hours assisting people from grocery separating to hooking up wires on the tv. I wouldn‚Äôt change it for anything. Help others. It‚Äôs important. Share love. It‚Äôs important.
"It is so satisfying helping someone by being able to describe their surroundings or something as little as helping them choose a shirt to wear. I highly encourage you to download this app and help. It takes sometime to get a call, but when you do, it‚Äôs nice to be able to help. Try it and see, no pun intended. What do you have to lose?"
"I LOVE that something like this is available. My aunt lost her vision a few years before she passed away, she was such a strong independent woman and this was such an adjustment for our family. I wish I‚Äôd have known something like this was available to help her. It‚Äôs the whole reason I downloaded the app, as a way to give back in return for all she ever did for me. Amazing."
"What a brilliant idea. I volunteered and received my first call within a couple of days. I was able to help an individual determine the power remaining on a device he was using.  I was glad to be of assistance.  And each day when I open the app on my phone, I see more volunteers joining the network.  Awesome!  I hope more people requiring assistance will try the app."
"Whoever made this app is a genius with a great heart. I love everything about this app! It is so wholesome and a great ideaü§ó.  All I ask is that everyone take it seriously, I found this app through TikTok and I find a lot of people wanting to mislead these poor souls.  Please just help them and move on, there is no need for joking or making fun! üòÅ 5 stars!"
"There should be a setting where you can choose time periods throughout the day that you can answer calls. I go to school and I cannot answer calls between 8 and 15. This would be extremely helpful, especially for the blind as to prevent them from wasting their time by calling people who have work or school schedules. Otherwise, this is a great app with a revolutionary concept."
"As a sighted user that has the joy of assisting those with limited or no sight, I can‚Äôt say enough what a joy it is. 
It makes me smile to know I‚Äôm helping someone else‚Äôs day go a little bit smoother and it really has made my days go smoother as well; a fresh outlook or appreciation for your own world can really have a positive ripple effect."
I got a call 2 months after signing up. I was in class for med school and jumped out of my chair and out of the lecture room to answer this call and it was amazing. I helped someone who truly needed my help and was so thankful! We even had a lovely conversation as if we were friends! This is an amazing concept and I can‚Äôt wait for more calls in the future
"This app has a wonderful point and seems very helpful to those in need. I just with I could be more of assistance in helping. I never get calls to help people, probably because there are over 1 million people here to assist those in need of visual help. But what percentage of people wanting to help still want to help. Is there a way to see who‚Äôs actually helping and get rid of the others? This disappoints me."
Great application.  So far I‚Äôve gotten four calls and been able to help 3 of the 4.   One call had poor sound and we could not hear each other adequately.    Such a wonderful feeling to help someone out with something as simple for me as reading directions on the back of a package or identifying what color a shirt is.     Love it!!
"Best feeling you can have is when you help someone. This app extends your ability to people you may never meet. 
I just helped someone check their thermostat settings and you know what - no matter how big or small the task, each opportunity is a chance to make someone‚Äôs day a little easier. Thanks for helping me help someone else."
I heard about Be My Eyes a few days ago and signed up for it. You help people who are blind and vision impaired do things like check expiration labels and find dropped items and etc. I just got my first call and it was a woman from Alabama who needed help identifying some spices. Feels good to help people and what an awesome use of this technology in our pockets.
Over the past year I‚Äôve received about 6 calls from people needing assistance. I‚Äôve helped people with things as simple as does this shirt match this skirt or what is the name on this perfume bottle. What a brilliant concept this is..it takes just a few minutes to help someone but the feeling you‚Äôre left with afterwards lasts a lot longer than that. üíóüíóüíó
"What a simple and beautiful thing. I love this app so much. It‚Äôs such a simple process and literally doesn‚Äôt take more than 2-5 minutes to help someone out and make a difference in someone‚Äôs life. The people are always so thankful and that just makes me feel even better. I wish I could get more calls, I love every time I get one."
"Wonderful service that puts those who are blind in touch with someone who is seeing. Over the last 3.5yrs I have received and answered roughly 10 calls that have ranged from identifying food in a freezer, to helping them with tech issues. I love being able to help someone who needs it!"
"I have used ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù on numerous occasions to help me out. I‚Äôm blind and no matter when I need assistance with something, someone is always there. The volunteers are absolutely amazing. They‚Äôre always very nice, polite, kind, patient, understanding, caring, able to help out, and an asset to anyone who requires some much needed sight to navigate their surroundings."
An incredible idea that has now changed the lives of millions of people. The functionality is great and I can‚Äôt tell you how rewarding it is to help out  this amazing community. If you believe the world should be more accessible for everyone then you have to download this app.
"But I‚Äôve been a member for over a Year and have yet to receive a call?

I just received my first call a few days ago! Yay! Was so happy to help this lady letting her know that her fish looked cooked all the way through! Can‚Äôt wait to help more people that are visually impaired! Thank you so much for creating this wonderful, helpful app!!!"
"Love the app but a ‚ÄúReady to Assist‚Äù option would be great on the volunteer side. For example I‚Äôm often up late at night but I don‚Äôt get connected with people due to it being nighttime where I live. I would love an option to say that even though it‚Äôs late I could still help people. However, that‚Äôs my only complaint. Great app with great people!"
I have only received a few calls as of this review but each one was so fulfilling and I actually had some great conversations after helping the user solve their problem. If you want to be the change you want to see in the world than this is a great place to start. Great idea and even better execution!
"I love the idea of this app! I would love to help people. I am able to see, and would love to help people who ask, but when I tried downloading the app it put me as someone who needs the help. And I can‚Äôt seem to figure out why or how or how to change it. I deleted it in frustration, in a few days I‚Äôll re download it in hope this has been resolved."
"This is such an awesome app. 
It feels amazing being able to help others. 
I‚Äôve helped two people so far with just simple things like picking out clothes or figuring out which bag of chips they have. 
Very easy, quick, and a lot of fun!!! 
Thanks for the giving those in need this opportunity."
"This app is so unique, and I absolutely love it. I‚Äôve helped 2 people already, a little nervous due to the newness of it all, but I‚Äôm always happy to help!

Needs only one bit of improvement: I had no idea how to decline a call while I was busy with someone. Could the seeing eyes have a toggle for availability? Or maybe pass the call on to another seeing person if it gets declined by someone.

Thank you for this app! It‚Äôs so wholesome!"
"I‚Äôve answered 4 calls so far, and they‚Äôve all been great. You get to help someone, plus meet nice people. 

It‚Äôs not difficult at all. Someone calls, you answer. Then you help them adjust their thermostat, find their dog in the house, or something equally no-biggie, and maybe chat for a minute or two.

Such a great app!"
"I feel like the blind people should be the ones to rate, but I had my first experience today as a sighted person and it was delightful. So happy to help. I‚Äôve been a member since July 2019 and I‚Äôve never gotten a call. My best friend, who was blind, died recently and it was such an honor and privilege to help. I hope he got it all sorted out. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Signed up as a volunteer a few days ago, and just completed my first call. I helped a lady change the temp on her thermostats. This app is amazing. Such a game changer for people who are blind. I can see how this app can be extremely useful and will definitely keep using it. Whoever created this app deserves a MAJOR pat on the back."
"This app provides a wonderful way to be able to help someone. The app has a very easy to use interface. Amazing idea.  My grandmother was blind when I was a child. Later my mother went blind due to macular degeneration. Although this app wasn‚Äôt around to help them, it can help so many people now."
"I‚Äôm a seeing volunteer and think it‚Äôs awesome I can help out in this small way.
I‚Äôve heard this app has changed the lives of the users of this app in a major way.
One user shared this app had helped her all through her college years and she would have never been able to graduate with the help of this app.
The founder of this app is to be commended."
People helping people. What a wonderful way to connect and help other human beings. The few times I was fortunate to be connected with someone a small amount of time makes a big difference. We‚Äôre all one family under the stars and this app made that saying more real.
"1) You will try and answer and someone has grabbed the call already. But don‚Äôt let that keep you from using this app

2) The feeling you get for helping someone is totally worth the wait. I have been able to help a few people over the last year. And things so basic like reading cooking instructions or reading the dials on an appliance seem simple but to the person calling you know you‚Äôre a huge help. 

Totally worth it. 

Only thing that would be cool is seeing stats and where you are in a queue for your next call.

Do your soul and karma some good and get this app."
"What an empowering tool to help with independence. I‚Äôve had great conversations with the calls I‚Äôve answered. It is definitely a testament to the power of One. How much one person, one small kind act, a few minutes of our your day can make a Big Impact in the life of someone else."
"It‚Äôs an honor to be of service. When I am busy, stressed, sad, angry, tired, or whatever... I answer the call from Be My Eyes.
Every time I see a blind person needing help, I instantly remember how grateful I am that I have my vision, and it makes me grateful to be of help. 
It‚Äôs truly a practice in gratitude, service, and personal growth."
I just got my first call after having this app for a month. I got to help someone turn their air on because it was stuck on the heat. He was so grateful & the feeling of being able to help someone with such a small gesture is addictive. I wish I could answer calls all day lol!!
"Thank you God for my eyes and for allowing me to be the eyes for someone! 
Please join ‚Äúbe my eyes‚Äù community!
I just had my first call and it was amazing! He was so thankful for being able to get information about an event! 
This calls take only few minutes! And the feeling after is indescriptible! There is Spanish option!"
"So I‚Äôm a volunteer and live to get calls to help.  It‚Äôs a small way to help.  My husband is a computer scientist and engineer is also totally blind, be my eyes increases his independence and when he is cooking be my eyes is as important to the meal as the ingredients or utensils that he is using.  As a counselor specializing in issues of  blindness I‚Äôve installed be my eyes in literally 100s of devices for my clients to use"
"Love this app. Always feel upset when I‚Äôm unable to catch a call in time. Sincerely wish I got more requests. Have had such genuine experiences and interactions through this. Strongly support anyone considering getting this app, there‚Äôs honestly no reason not to. Have a wonderful day!"
"I wish the app had a feature where the sighted person and blind person could type back and forth. This would be immensely beneficial for Deafblind people, for obvious reasons. But it would also be beneficial for any blind person who wants some information without announcing it to everyone within earshot. Texting feature, please!"
This app has an amazing concept.  I‚Äôve been a member since November 26th 2019.  I‚Äôve received 2 calls and have had a great experience on here.  I feel so grateful and privileged to lend my eyesight to those who are blind or low vision.  This gives me a lot of faith in humanity and truly humbled me  I look forward to receiving more calls and assuring many others.
"This app is such a great idea! Calls are typically few and far between but I always look forward to answering calls, as it elicits the same excitement level as receiving a call from Santa. Also knowing you are helping someone in the simplest yet fulfilling way is an easy way to perform a good deed of the day. Mahalo, Be My Eyes, for utilizing smart phones in an ingenious manner."
I had the opportunity to help a nice gentleman match a shirt and pants for church this morning over my cup of coffee. It was an incredible way to start my day and brighten my mood. This is an incredible app and I hope to receive more calls soon. I recommended Be My Eyes to all my friends on Facebook. This is easily my favorite app now.
My only question/issue is that when someone calls I have to swipe and press etc. on my iPhone and it never picks up quick enough. Y'all need to incorporate a fast answer/insta-connect option so the sighted volunteers and chose that option to immediately answer a call. If that's possible.
I recently helped a couple of college students sort through their mail.  It made me realize how many little things that I take for granted every day.  I am glad I was able to make their day just a little bit easier and I'm glad things like this app exist to give differently abled people a little more Independence.
I‚Äôm a volunteer on this app. This app is very easy to use and so secure....I‚Äôve had the opportunity to help two people so far and they were both great experiences and did not take much time (although I would gladly have given more time if needed). Highly recommend this and strongly suggest you share it with any sight-impaired person you know.
"It would seem every time I‚Äôve helped a visually impaired user they have brightened my day or given me a piece of joy that I‚Äôve been able to carry with me after the call!  I find myself spending more time chatting with the user than identifying what they need!  Brilliant idea for an app, easy to use and a great service to all who use it!"
It‚Äôs rewarding to be able to help someone! I got my first call today and it was very simple and it only took about 3-4 minutes. It barely takes any time out of your day and yet you make someone‚Äôs day just a little bit better.
I have friends of my own that are visually impaired and for most of them they tell me a feeling of helplessness they tend to have toward every day tasks. To have an app like this where they can easily call someone for Help no matter what time of day it is can help build back their confidence and improve their life and it's a really great concept.
"I just had my first call, there have been a couple that I‚Äôve missed and it broke my heart. It‚Äôs so amazing to know how many people are here to help others. My call was quick but such a great feeling to know I helped...I love this app and God bless those who created it! What an amazing way to serve others! Thank you for the opportunity!"
I got my first call this month. I helped a woman distinguish between the shampoo and conditioner bottles at her hotel. Was early in the morning and I took the call from the warmth of my bed in my pjs. Took less than 2 minutes. The woman was very nice. Felt good to start my day helping someone with something I take for granted. Definitely a win/win for everyone.
"Quite likely the number one most helpful smart phone app to me as a blind man. I have been able to do my own laundry, distinguish food in the pantry, label vitamins and herbs, get my computer talking again when it had frozen,  and even assemble a mini greenhouse through the help of their awesome volunteers!! Would recommend to anyoneüò∏"
"This is such an innovative way to help a visually impaired person when they are needing at the most. It takes only a few minutes to assist them, and it‚Äôs based on your availability.I just finished my first call, and it was such an enjoyable experience."
"I think it‚Äôs a good app very useful for the people it‚Äôs trying to help, but it‚Äôs not much thought behind it after that, where the explanation for how to get callers? Why is it that they can only reach out to you. I got ONE call the lady was nice, very talkative which I like we had great conversation about her kids, the life she‚Äôs living etc but I haven‚Äôt gotten anything after that, why isn‚Äôt there more detail"
"Wonderful app, easy to figure out how to answer a call. It was the coolest experience to help someone who can‚Äôt see with their computer when their voice control turned off. What a beautiful and unexpected gift it was to be able to help someone in new ways."
This is a great idea for an app! I love helping people as much as I can even in the smallest ways! This makes it even easier to help out your fellow man! I recommend this app to everyone I know! The ones who sign up seem to truly enjoy helping someone else out and it‚Äôs a great way to even make an amazing friend!
But if you can answer with a record voice it would be even better....then they can listen to it when ever they wanted...and some people may don‚Äôt want to actually call someone else to ask so they can record they‚Äôre voice so the volunteers can listen later and answer it
"Awesome app, everyone should download it as a just in case, in the 10 months I‚Äôve had it I‚Äôve only had the opportunity to help one person so if you download it it‚Äôll probably be a while until you get a call but you could make someone‚Äôs day that much easier in 30 seconds"
"This is one of the easiest ways to help others! Most calls are under a minute, but if neither of you is in a hurry, it can go longer. I helped a gal pair up matching outfits the other day and my husband just helped someone who was cooking. It‚Äôs fun and easy and so worth it!!"
"It was pure luck that I got my first call a minute after downloading the app. A lady needed help with the brand of the diapers she was holding at a pharmacy. I told her the brand, she thanked me and we hung up. It felt so good to be able to make someone‚Äôs life easier!"
"I‚Äôve had the app for over a year and finally got a call today. The woman asked me the colors of her shirt and pants and I was able to tell her and that they matched. I also helped her pick out matching socks. It felt great to help, and so easily on my part. Amazing app. I can‚Äôt wait for another call."
"I‚Äôve been able to assist two people at this point and it always makes my day better.
Although the requests are small, it makes a difference in the daily lives of people. This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used!"
"It makes me happy that there are way more volunteers then blind people signed up for this service.  It means humanity still has hope.  After a year of being a volunteer, I answered my first call today.  Something simple.  Identifying a bag of beans.  Someone is cooking beans and sausage for dinner tonight.  

Sometimes I love technology"
"I love this app! It‚Äôs a quick, easy way to put some good out into the world and help someone. The interface is easy to use, and I haven‚Äôt had any trouble with it. I don‚Äôt get a lot of calls (I‚Äôve only gotten 3 or for in the last 6 months), but it‚Äôs always a good experience!"
"i‚Äôve always had a passion for helping people. this app allows me to do for others what they can‚Äôt do for themselves. i had the sweetest interaction earlier today, actually. a young boy reached out and i accepted his call. he was trying to differentiate between essential oils. at the end of the call, he thanked me, and said ‚Äúi love you‚Äù. it was the sweetest thing, coming from such a young child. of course i told him i loved him as well :) the smallest things mean the most to them‚ù§Ô∏èchildren make my heart happy. i love helping others, young and old. best app on the store, 10/10 recommended."
My sister in law Debbie was blind. We recently lost her but she would have loved to have had the chance to use something like this to help her. I am absolutely so grateful to be able to help and give back in her memory üíú This gives freedom to those who may have been unable to go and do things before.
"I had my first call today as a volunteer, and it was an amazing experience. Helped someone figure out the bus they‚Äôre supposed to go on. It was lovely chatting for a couple minutes and being able to help. It‚Äôs also wonderful to feel connected with someone across the other side of the world. What an amazing app!!!"
"I think this app is amazing, I recommend it for anybody to use it. It makes you feel great to be able to just help someone who you don‚Äôt know to do something they just can‚Äôt see. I downloaded this app yesterday and got my first call on thanksgiving evening."
Whoever came up with this idea is a beautiful person and truly selfless. What a nice and convenient way to help our fellow man. I‚Äôm glad there are still people out there who genuinely want to help others and expect not want anything back. Learning of this app restored some of my faith in humanity. Thank you.
Using this app and helping others makes you think about someone other than yourself.  It helps you problem solve and think of how easy a sighted person has it.
Every call I have gotten have been the nicest people. So patient and kind. It‚Äôs such a good feeling after these calls to know you helped someone with someone that we take for granted. Sight. I will answer a call anywhere anytime just to know I helped someone. This is the best app ‚ù§Ô∏è
As long as you have good service this app works great. I won‚Äôt answer unless I do because it will really make it hard and I don‚Äôt want the person asking for help to get frustrated. Besides that it feels great to be able to help no matter how big or small the task is.
"This app is incredible! I just had my first call and I guided a blind gentleman on one of his ‚Äúdaily strolls‚Äù around his neighborhood. It was rewarding to help, I had great conversation the whole time, and it reminded to be thankful for the little things. It was really a fun experience and I‚Äôm looking forward to my next call"
"With this amazing app I have had the privilege of helping so many people! The requests are simple such as ‚Äúwhat are the cooking directions on this package of noodles?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat is the expiration date?‚Äù, and ‚Äúis this wrapping paper for a birthday or for Christmas?‚Äù. Just simple everyday things that only take a minute or two, but can really help someone."
"Immediately after signing up for this app, I started getting a ton of spam emails. Legitimately like 100 each day since I downloaded the app. I tried to sign up without sharing my email address but could not, and it was specifically mentioned when I was forced to provide my email address that it would not be shared. Clearly a huge lie. Downloaded this app to try and do something nice and am now dealing with all of this spam email. Not happy at all. And it‚Äôs probably all for naught because I likely won‚Äôt get a call to assist on."
"Becoming disabled in my forties was devastating, not the least because it made it so hard to be able to continue to volunteer and give back to others. I love that this app gives me the opportunity to help others, and that it helps me to still feel useful."
"Wow, I just received my first Be My Eyes üëÄ call this morning, I signed up yesterday. It was so nice meeting and helping someone new, THANK YOU üòä Be My Eye‚Äôs üëÄ!!! If you haven‚Äôt installed Be My Eyes üëÄ yet do it NOW you‚Äôll be so grateful you did after receiving your first call ‚òéÔ∏è Btw a logging feature would be nice to keep track of the people you‚Äôve helped üôÇ"
"I‚Äôll gladly devote time to more complex issues, but so far I‚Äôve had the super EASY privilege of letting a woman know that her milk was still good for two more days. I couldn‚Äôt believe how great it felt! This is such a GREAT premise! I can‚Äôt wait for it to be used for other needs! Old folks needing a ride, novices in need of expertise, bartering, there must be more of this concept in use!!"
"As a sighted person, I don‚Äôt get frequent calls to help, so it isn‚Äôt overwhelming. I get to help when I can and I can decline a call if I‚Äôm unavailable. 
This app helps so many, and you feel great for having the opportunity to help. 
I have had this app for something like two years now, and I‚Äôll never delete it."
I cannot say good enough things about this app because it truly does help the visually impaired. They don‚Äôt always have a family member or friend that can help them and there are double the amount of helpers for these people. That way they always have someone there.
"So gratifying that I could help someone so easily, and I just signed up yesterday! I just answered my phone (it came up as a ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù call), helped a man identify some money, and that was it! There was some minor audio delay but it was still clear. Can‚Äôt wait for my next call üòÅ"
"This app takes a random moment out of your day and turns it into a way to put good vibes out into the world. It makes it so easy to help someone and it usually only takes a minute or two of your time. 

There‚Äôs no feeling like knowing that you are helping someone be more independent."
I really enjoy this app as I get to help a person in need. I often get calls nightly and feel honored to help a visually impaired person. I recently spoke to one of the persons in need and they had a great idea of creating a Be My Ears App to help hearing impaired. Anyone out there who could create such an app?  Glad to help anyone who need assistance. üòÄüëç
"I wonder why there isn‚Äôt more impaired people enrolled when there are over 5 million helpers, but I‚Äôve answered several of these calls and they are easy and it‚Äôs nice to help someone in need! Love the app!! Wish I could help more
People but this is my first baby step :)"
"maybe im a little soft or easily touched but i cried with my first experience with this app , it made me feel good and worth more than what i feel i am sometimes. I love helping people it makes me feel....needed. This is an experience i loved so much and i highly recommend"
"I rarely get requests, but when I do, it‚Äôs usually shortly after opening the app. Not sure if background refresh is causing this, or if there just so many helpers out there. Either way, the app works as intended and the idea behind it is lovely."
I am a volunteer and I just took my first call and was able to help a visually impaired person work a new light that his family bought for him! It was something so simple but it felt amazing to be able to help! I think this app is truly amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to keep taking calls and helping out!
"First off I am a sighted person. I think this app is just amazing as it allows people with vision problems to connect to a person who can see when they have an issue they cannot resolve on their own. Technology like this, used properly as it is here gives me hope for the human race."
"They can‚Äôt regulate weather the volunteers discriminate or not, and I understand that. Still, as far as customer support goes, the emailed help I received from the founder themselves was super unprofessional, condescending and sarcastic. Also, volunteers have a huge lack of sensitivity training. Make some short videos or something about how to help people before just allowing them into the personal lives of others. Too bad, because this concept is wonderful, but I won‚Äôt support such terrible business practices."
"I got my first call before Christmas and I helped a man read some coffee labels and other Christmasy type labels fr coffee to candies, it did not take long and I was thrilled to be helpfulüôè
I would only change ONE thing, my alert doesn‚Äôt let me get to my iPad or phone fast enough, ai cant figure out how to change that setting"
"This is a great App! I enjoy helping others & I enjoy answering calls. 
I‚Äôve missed a few calls by being too slow answering & I get a little disappointed. I‚Äôve answered a few calls & the other person on the other end your helping us very grateful. The app is user friendly & simple to set up."
"Thank you for allowing me to share my sight. It‚Äôs such a privilege ‚ô•Ô∏è
Also, I have a request. Under stories, I realized that all the people have countries listed for them, however, ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù is used very carelessly. 
We honestly can‚Äôt be having these conversations in 2018, Africa is a continent. Just as someone is from Canada, Africa has 50+ countries. Please correct this. Otherwise, great app."
"I‚Äôve taken two calls since I joined a few months ago.  What joy it brings me to help.  I think everyone should have this app.  The only thing I can say to someone considering joining as a volunteer, ‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù  It gives you the best feeling to help someone by being their eyes.  You will not regret it!"
I seemed to get more when I first signed up.     I love being able to help - most questions are so fast I can even answer at work.   I wish I could help more often.    But a great app Easy to answer the calls.
"This app and the service it provides is amazing.  I only get to answer a call about once a year due the odds.  There are several million helpers while there are only 350,000 blind subscribers.  So, that leaves very few chances you‚Äôll be able to answer a call."
"I got my first call!  I love that I get to be in service for fellow humans.  Super easy!  Call didn‚Äôt last long.  I could see how some questions could, but if you don‚Äôt have a moment- the call will be answered by someone else.  I recommend this over and over.  Spread the love üíõ"
"This is a great way to lend your abilities to others who are visually challenged. I have helped callers read an expiration date on food, describe their building so they can call for pick up, and even find Takis in a convenience store. A perfect use of technology to lift people up!"
"This app is truly amazing. I just answered my first call, and it was such an amazing experience. The woman was so kind, and being able to help her with something, even as small as whether or not she had the right seasoning mix, made me feel so good. Being able to help someone even in such a small way warms your heart."
"I never review apps, but this one is pretty amazing. To be able to answer a simple question immediately to a person who is blind or has low vision, is unbelievable. If you‚Äôre busy when you get a call, there‚Äôs a dozen other people waiting to answer, it‚Äôs first come, first serve, no worries."
"I used this app for the first time literally 3 minutes ago. I assisted a blind lady with choosing the correct temperature on her washer and I can‚Äôt wait to help someone else! She was so nice. This has to be the most profound, helpful app in the entire App Store. I HIGHLY recommend that you download this app and get to helping others!! I absolutely love it."
"Loved the idea but was a little nervous about my first call, thinking I might get inappropriate images. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to help someone with an activity I take for granted: making sure clothes match. It took less than 1 minute and I did it from an Uber, on my way to a commitment."
This is a great app! My friend has recently gone blind and this app along with other technology gives hope and independence to blind people. Please share this app and rate this app if your reading this and it brought you hope for your friend or loved one!! More shares more technology more hope= quality of life goes up!! Thanks
"As a sighted person, it‚Äôs great to be able to help people who are in need. The people I‚Äôve helped using this app have all been very nice, and I‚Äôm so glad to be able to lend my eyes when they‚Äôre needed. It just takes a minute or two every once in a while, and it‚Äôs amazingly helpful to the people who need it."
Be My Eyes is incredible. What an amazing concept. So far I've helped someone order something of a menu and I helped someone else find her house phone that was hidden behind her couch. Both people and calls were very heartwarming. I was so happy I could help them.
"I LOVE this app. I have only received a few calls since I started but each time makes me feel so happy, and also very thankful for things I so frequently take for granted. This is an amazing app and makes it so easy to anonymously help someone."
"I‚Äôve only gotten to answer one call, but geeze.. knowing at any moment I can help someone. This app gives me pride and joy that I am able to help others. This is so user friendly and easy to understand. Definitely recommend!"
"It feels good to help others with something we take for granted every day, our vision. 

It‚Äôs so simple to help, and one of the easiest ways to give back, thank you be my eyes for giving us the opportunity to help others through this app!"
"I‚Äôve been a volunteer since August 9th, 2019. Since then I‚Äôve had a small handful of calls. Each and every one of them left me feeling so touched that I could do something as simple as read a captcha to someone or help them pick out clothes. So happy to be a volunteer ü•∫üíó"
Awesome amazing wonderful community! I love this app so much i get excited anytime i get a notification luckily im Bilingual so i have alittle bit more of a chance to get some one. This is keeping me from going crazy in quarantine i love that i can interact with another person it can get boring in isolation lol
"My family is blind and I always like to be with them. I have certificates to help Special Needs. I am happy that this app exists. It helps them when I‚Äôm not around, since I have work and school. I also use this app, because I‚Äôm glad to help out others :)"
"I love the app and have been able to help one person so far but, I would really like to have the option to change the alert sound. The sound now is not loud enough to be heard when I‚Äôm in public. Please think about adding that option. Thanks"
"Every time I get a call, it does my heart good! So far every call I have received, the person in need is ALWAYS so sweet. 

The only downside I have found to signing up to assist the blind is that I don‚Äôt called to help someone enough. There are so many people volunteering to help the blind, that it takes a while to rotate back around to receive another call. 

This app is the favorite out of all my apps!  I actually get to help someone right then and there. It warms my heart knowing a simple answer to a question makes all the difference in the world to someone on the other end of the phone!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Every time I get to help someone through this app, it feels like I won the lottery. 

The app has just the right amount of functionality, making its operation easy in my panic to respond quickly.

I hope the developers know that they have done a very good thing for blind, low vision, and sighted society."
I‚Äôm ecstatic that I was able to help someone out in their time of need. The app was seamless and worked beautifully. The view was clear and crisp and the sound was sharp. Can‚Äôt wait for more calls to come! What a great concept for those of us who want to help others but are sometimes unsure as to how. üíû
"Through this app, I was able to help someone do something that I take for granted - sort money. That simple act made me feel so good, I smiled for days. I can‚Äôt wait for someone else to need my assistance. Thank you for creating this app. You allow people to get so much more than is given."
The idea behind this app is amazing. I can‚Äôt believe it doesn‚Äôt have more recognition. By simply taking 5 minutes out of my day I can make someone else‚Äôs life a whole lot easier. I‚Äôm so happy that I can help the blind through this app and I will continue to support this app for as long as I can!
"Magnificent app!

Now that my vision has decreased so substantially I don‚Äôt know how I would manage without apps such as this one. It is amazing to speak to a live person and get the help you need exclamation not to mention it is free and totally helpful.

Thank you so much to everybody involved in creating  and volunteering"
"While the video will occasionally lag if the caller or receiver has a bad connection, it's about what you would expect from video conferencing. I love conversing with people from around the world, and the feeling I get when I can help someone. Only downside is it doesnt ring frequently ENOUGH! :-)"
"I love being able others to help by using this app! It is a wonderful feeling, being to help others and make their lives easier just by a having a quick chat. Thank you to whoever created this app!"
"I volunteer to help people through this app. I only get calls occasionally, but every call, no matter how short or long, is meaningful. If you haven‚Äôt added this app, please do. You will be making a difference in the independence of a fellow person."
"With Covid19 keeping most of us in Illinois on lockdown for almost a year now, it‚Äôs gotten harder and harder to stay positive. This app lets me help others in an innovative way that keeps everyone safe. I am overwhelmed with happiness every single time I get a call to help someone. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I‚Äôve had a couple calls, my wife has had none. Is there a way to keep the ‚Äúmissed‚Äù notification somewhere on screen? Let us know everything's working properly."
"I got my first call today! Yes, I feel great! Yes, it‚Äôs good to give back! Yes, it took less than a minute to help someone out! She asked,‚Äù what kind of candy bar is this!‚Äù I was overjoyed to be able to provide her with such little information, yet it felt wonderful! Enjoy your candy bar."
"The thing about life is that no one can do it alone, and no one should go through life alone. So if you can help, be that person, always find the helpers in the world‚Äîalways be the helper in the world. It‚Äôll be a much better place for all if we do more for others."
I‚Äôve answered a few calls and love being able to help my fellow humans!  1 just wanted to make sure the can in the pantry was what they intended.  Another just wanted to walk through the house and ensure all lights were off.  Quick calls but so helpful and glad I can do a part!
"Download it and forget it! I haven‚Äôt yet had an opportunity to help someone through this app, but have only gotten a couple requests sent. I was driving or didn‚Äôt respond fast enough for those but there are millions of ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù so they always find someone who is available super fast."
"I am so happy to help! üòÅ I am a teacher and to be able to have friends, family and students see you guide someone is so valuable! It‚Äôs interesting to see what hurdles low or no vision people face on a daily basis. I have a friend who is slowly losing his vision, I love knowing he can have the support of Be My Eyes when he needs it."
"After I got sick with cancer and had an immediate life change I knew I wanted to do anything big or small to help other people. 
I came across this app and immediately knew it was for me. 
I‚Äôve only probably had about 10 calls overall in the past 2 years I have been a volunteer, but every time it‚Äôs been a warm, honest experience. 
I love to help. I love to feel connected and know that I helped one person that day. 
Brilliant app. Wonderful people on both ends. 
Im proud to be a part of this and continue to do so indefinitely. 

Marielle"
"So far I‚Äôve gotten 4 calls in the last 2 years. The calls aren‚Äôt very often because there are so many more volunteers than people to seek the help, but when every call was worth the wait. It feels so nice to help give back."
"This app is super easy to use and a great way to help others from wherever you are. There are a ton of volunteers on the app so it‚Äôs not very often that I get the pleasure of answering a call, but when I do get one it‚Äôs very rewarding! Thank you for creating such a useful app."
If you love helping people and want to to help someone in need this is the app for you.  When you get a notification it only takes a few minutes of your time and you feel good knowing that you helped someone else.
I have helped people pick out to for everything from pants for a date to find the right soup for dinner. I‚Äôve helped people read mail and understand things. This is an amazing app! It only takes a couple minutes to help someone. You should download it too!
But I would love to help someone but the few times I'll get the notification that someone needs help by the time I open my phone (like 3 seconds after getting the notification) someone else has already answered the call. I wish I could get the chance to help. Maybe give the volunteer at least 5-8 seconds to answer??
"I love this app! Awesome concept. As a doctoral student I have little time to volunteer in the traditional sense, this app makes it possible to serve in a meaningful and convenient way. I actually get excited when a call comes in! It's been a pleasure to connect with/help folks from around the globe. I encourage you to join the fun!"
It‚Äôs a win win. The person calling you gets much needed help and you feel a whole lot better when you do. It was a very nice feeling starting my day helping someone and it‚Äôs easy! I come from a customer service background and it was a very natural flowing conversation.
"I love this app! It gives you the opportunity of stopping your everyday routine to help someone in need. And takes you out of your element and reminds you to not take the things we have for granted. When you help someone, you instantly feel overjoyed, I love it and I know you will too!"
"Im always moved by good works, with humanity and affection. I've helped ( i cant call it help tbh, its the least that we could do ) many blind people, I've had different experiences and stories, and I've never been more thankful for being in contact with them. Being able to do something good. God bless you üíï"
"I‚Äôve only gotten 1 call so far, but wow! It feels amazing to be able to help someone. To be able to help someone you don‚Äôt know and to be able to make such an impact in a stranger‚Äôs life. Even by doing the simplest of things like reading a bill, a card, or helping pick out clothes. Such a blessing to be a blessing."
"The app is SO easy to use. When I get a notification for a call, I jump at the chance to answer. It‚Äôs so nice to be about to help and is a great expansion of your knowledge of how individuals cope with being sightless. Everyone that I‚Äôve answered a call for has been so nice and appreciative."
"Two strangers that shared a moment of love, helpfulness and kindness. Hoped for eachother the best and went their separate ways. This just made my whole day‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you so much for this app. It doesn‚Äôt only help the visually impaired, but also the in need for a selfless moment."
"This is absolutely amazing! I love helping any way I can so when I heard of this app I was so excited to be a part of it, I can‚Äôt wait to receive my first call! They give instructions with pre recorded calls to try before a real call too and it‚Äôs all so easy"
"So i saw this on IG, and i thought it would be awesome if i could help. I know several people who are visually impaired, and this app and community is making their day to day lives easier, and they are allowing others to help. I absolutely love the app and how easy it has made it for everyone to get involved"
"Although calls are few and far between, it‚Äôs great to see an app that has millions able to assist the low vision and blind people of the world! When calls come, I know that if I can‚Äôt answer it immediately, there are thousands the receive the same alert."
"I have only been able to answer a few calls since I have had this application, but feel blessed to be able to help. I like the way that the application lets the blind person use their cellphone camera to show me what they need help understanding and how it enables us to talk."
"There is nothing better than being able to meet someone and help them out at the same time. I was beyond excited, I honestly felt like a child throughout the whole call. I absolutely love what this app does and I think this is the best app out there, I cannot wait for my next call ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I took my first call today. I helped a woman decipher which seasoning packet was for meatloaf and which was beef stew. When we hung up I felt overjoyed that I was able to assist someone else so much so effortlessly. I about cried it made me feel that good. 
10/10."
"I will never not have this app on my phone. The camera quality is great, audio quality is also great. Given your WiFi or LTE service. It‚Äôs a great feeling to help others, and I recommend this app whenever the conversation arises."
"I love this alp and I feel so good after each call!
The ONLY thing I would change is the ringer. I cannot adjust the volume or tone and it‚Äôs barely audible unless the phone is in my hand. Wish I could adjust."
"I signed up to be a volunteer to help those who are visually impaired. I have helped others with color clothing choices, canned food ingredients and reading a receipt for bookkeeping purposes. I love love this. I love helping and I‚Äôm so glad this is available for those who need it."
"I signed up over a year ago and have patiently waited for my call to help. I finally got one today, and my heart feels so big. I am reminded to appreciate the easy and little things in life we often take for granted. Such a humbling and feel good experience. I love this and i can‚Äôt wait for my next call."
"Answering calls for folks on this app is so easy and so rewarding! Providing assistance that is so easy as a sighted person gives me an incredible feeling every single time.

A true demonstration of the power of technology to help people and connect us with each other in meaningful ways."
"There are so many apps that can help you do just about anything, but this app allows you to help someone else that without it can be challenged doing the things we take for grated.  Get this app, and you will feel good for helping others by simply being the eyes for them."
"If you are blind, this app will give you access to people who love helping. You no longer have to worry about asking the same people for help over and over. 

If you are sighted, getting a call and helping someone will brighten your day and satisfy the deep desire to be of value to others."
"I downloaded the app a few months ago. I got my first call a few weeks ago helping a woman read her insurance card while she was sitting at a diner eating breakfast! How cool is that? A simple iPhone app just changed the game for the visually impaired. Whoever thought this up, good job!"
"My only problem is that it often takes too long to open the app to answer, and the call rolls to the next person. I'm hoping the latest version solves this, in which case I will up my rating to 5 stars. 
One of the calls I received was from a woman who said it changed her life by giving her more independence."
"Easy to use and provides a real service. I‚Äôve had it for a few years now and only had a couple of calls, but it seems to work perfectly as intended."
To be able to help someone in any kind of way makes me the happiest. Something as simple as helping someone pick the right color clothing makes my day. This app is the most amazing thing someone could have come up with ü•∞
I have had the app a little over a month now and finally got my first call! I got to help the sweetest man named Larry find a steak in his freezer! He was appreciative and I couldn‚Äôt help but tear up knowing I was able to help him. So happy I got this app!
So glad that there are so many volunteers! I don‚Äôt get many calls but I have gotten a handful and just answering questions of what color something is to a phone number makes my heart feel so much happier.
"Such a small thing for me to take a minute out of my day to answer a call from a blind person. you are helping someone with something that seems trivial to us but bc they‚Äôre blind, they need the help. If i miss a call, i feel solace to know someone else had gotten it."
I was very impressed with the Be My Eyes application specialized help section. I called the Microsoft disability answer desk and was able to have them reset the Microsoft store to get my applications to download properly. Definitely impressed with Be My Eyes in general. So grateful to the developer who made this application possible.
"I love to see technology being used for good. Be My Eyes is a perfect example! 

About 1x a month I get a Be My Eyes request. It‚Äôs a simple problem for me to answer‚ÄîIs this a $10 bill? Is this my new Medicare card? What is the setting on xyz? The question takes less than 45 seconds. How easy! 

I also love that we‚Äôre freeing up family members/ care givers. If you‚Äôve ever been a caregiver for a few hours or years, you know that any trusted help is appreciated. 

I‚Äôm so happy to be a part of Be My Eyes. Tell your friends/ family to join if they need help or to volunteer."
Download it now! The only excuse you can have is if you‚Äôre never on your phone. IF you‚Äôre always on your phone (which many of us are) it‚Äôs super easy to use and can help someone during a quick little painless video call. Spread it like wildfire.
I‚Äôm a volunteer and I had to wait over a year until I could finally help someone today for the first time. However it makes me happy to know there are so many people on call to help. This app is amazing and I‚Äôm happy to be a volunteer
Just being able to help someone out in their day makes my day.  I love this app and I recommend it to anyone that has a kind heart and wants to help people just because.   I‚Äôve recommend it to everyone I know
I just received my first call and it only took one day!! It was a lady asking the color of a shirt. We were both excited she was my first call! I can‚Äôt wait to get more calls. This app is amazing. Whoever thought of this deserves an award.
"I got my first call today, a male that had just shaved and wanted to make sure he was even on both sides, he was so nice and appreciative for the help! This is the most awesome app ever! I am a 911 dispatcher so I help people daily, it‚Äôs nice to be able to help visually impaired people when I can!"
"I‚Äôve been a volunteer since 2015 and taken several calls.  They‚Äôve all been unique, fun and simple.  It‚Äôs a great opportunity to easily help someone and it feels good to do it.
Human connection is important and I hope they‚Äôd do the same for me if I needed a bit of help."
I‚Äôve been a helper on this app for the past year (at least) and every single experience I‚Äôve had helping those who need it has been stellar. I love having the opportunity to help another person and this app always leaves me feeling happy and good.
I have only used this service 3 times and every time it has been awesome. I was trying to get my computer to speak and a BME volunteer was able to talk me through it. I have also used it to identify a bottle of wine and while in a store to identify and select snacks. Thanks bunches to all of the volunteers!
It really makes my day when I can help someone in need with just a simple app. I like the functionality of being able to use their flashlight on the other phone and of course the camera. Haven‚Äôt had any technical issues.
"When I got my first call I was so nervous but I answered and there was a nice older lady just wanting help finding the right can of beans to cook. Everything was so easy and effortless-definitely was overthinking it. 
I cannot wait to be selected again to help! 
‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
This is one of those apps that just touches my heart and seems so unreal. But you guys definitely have put this platform together very well! Just wish I was able to help more people more frequently!!
"My only complaint is not getting enough calls. ü•∞
I'm so excited about being a helper! I did receive one call and it was so great. I love the idea of an app created with the sole purpose of helping a person at a time. It restores my faith in humanity."
This innovative app works well when someone needs assistance with visual tasks. I love the incorporation of the flashlight/torch as it allows the assistant to provide extra light when they seen it necessary. Wonderfully done! I highly recommend this app.
"I answered my first call last night. I was so nervous. It wasn‚Äôt as easy due to the left and right and the camera, but we did it! The feeling of helping someone in need made my day. I highly recommend everyone to volunteer."
This app is so amazing. I love helping people who can‚Äôt see. Technology is very important now and days so why not make it useful. Hearing how people reply when I help them warms my heart. I will definitely keep this app on any device I come in contact with.
I got my first call today. Unfortunately what he was looking at was a schematic that I didn‚Äôt understand. I hope he was able to find someone who could help him. He was very kind and thanked me for trying to help. Wonderful App!!
"I love the idea of the app and I genuinely appreciate everybody who is able to help but I joined about 3 months ago and was excited to get my first call. And I never did and still haven‚Äôt I realized that their are almost 20x as many helpers as there are blind or in need of help, I take that into consideration as well. I just read a review that said he didn‚Äôt get a call for a year and a half. Someone fix the system"
I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of crazy things in my life and to step outside of myself and help someone for maybe 5 seconds brought me joy and showed me the things I‚Äôm worried about may it be as important. Thank you allowing me to help!
I get a call once every couple months and I‚Äôve only been lucky enough once to answer it. It was such a small thing but it helped out in the ways strangers might not usually want to help out. I definitely recommend it to everyone!
"Dear all ( Be my Eye developers )

Would like to have a point scale how we helped or not so you can encourage us to do more .

More to add there are some scams account one of them asked me for money ) and had sent a report about it but never heard back , by this bad guys can control the app thanks"
"Such an easy app to use and what an amazing service that it provides to others! I signed up on a Monday and received my first call on a Tuesday. Very simple tutorials to follow, preparing you for your first call. So easy to answer your calls when they come through. Very intuitive!"
"I downloaded the app 2 days ago, and the very next day I received a call. I was able to help someone from my pantry while my son was at school. How amazing it is to be able to help someone across the States from my house in my time off? Such an amazing idea and concept."
"What a great app!
Helping others is set up in such a way that it never imposes itself in your life.   If you are busy many volunteers are ready help.   
I wish Apple would do more promotions of your app and services.   
Keep up the great work!"
"Just had my first call this morning and I was able to help a blind man find an item in his pantry. 
Talk about thrilling!!! I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to see for someone who cannot. 
Very small, but nonetheless a great experience. 
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
I just received my first call from someone in Ireland that needed help reading something. I have the feeling he not only needed help but was lonely. I spoke to this kind soul for a minute or two and am very thankful that I was able to help.
"Wish there were more people to help. This app gives me all the feels when I answer the call. One missed call but was able to assist two people so far, about 6 months apart. Love this app and wish I could help more! 
Kindly,"
"I really love this app. Just doing the bare minimum, by simply helping find something, or read something, you can make someone‚Äôs day. This app is a great volunteer experience. It gives me so much joy that I can help and I‚Äôm just grateful for this opportunity."
I‚Äôve been an ‚ÄúAnswerer?‚Äù for Be My Eyes since it launched & I still enjoy getting a call & being able to help somebody real quick. Can of peas? Red shirt? Do these shoes match? Use your sight to help someone else. It‚Äôll make both of your days better. üåû
"The app is simple, clean and intuitive. Many apps today are cluttered with information and conflicting calls to action. The creators of Be My Eyes know what they‚Äôre solving and focus on it ‚Äî providing contextual, sighted assistance to the visually impaired on-demand. They do a great job."
"Whoever created this app is a blessing, I got my first call today and I have been so happy all day with the thought that I was able to help someone today I was so excited receiving that call, and can‚Äôt wait for many more!"
There are few things that bring me as much joy as being the one who gets to answer a call for a friend on Be My Eyes. I‚Äôm constantly bowled over by the kindness and grace of the people I meet on this app. What an amazing gift to be able to be a part of this community.
I‚Äôve been blind for five years now and I‚Äôve been using this app for little over two years. I‚Äôve had nothing but great experiences. Met some great people from all over the world. I highly recommend this app for people who are blind to get any help around the house or wherever. Great app.
"While my first call went on (after I was asked permission) for ten minutes or so, most calls are quick, simple, and easily answered.  Just remember you can ask to have the light turned on or the camera tilted!"
I am impressed at the seamless experience of this app. It provides a much needed service and allows it in a private and quick manner for users. I really enjoy getting a call and seeing how many people are volunteering!
"I have been using this app since 2019 and love answering the calls. If I miss a call, I‚Äôm disappointed- everyone I have been able to help has been so kind, and it was a boost in my day to be able to help a strap."
"A friend mentioned this company, and it resonated with me. I have taken numerous calls and I'm always humbled and grateful to help. To think that a few minutes of my day can mean the world to someone else...worth every minute to be a volunteer. Genius company and app."
"Great opportunity to volunteer, flexible, and important. Could really help or impact someone‚Äôs day or life with a simple call response.  Simple and efficient way for those that would like to volunteer to engage- even during a pandemic for example"
What a blessing this app is to those both in need and the volunteers. To be their eyes if only for a few moments brings back your faith in humanity and makes your heart full I promise you.
It was an older woman I believe she was blind she needed me to tell her how many whistles were in the party pack and what colors it felt amazing to be able to help someone else from somewhere else around the world‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüíû
I really love this app because it allows me to help others. I typically only get a call about once every 3 to 4 months and it can be as easy as asking me what color a jacket is or the color of a suit. #PayItForward #LoveAll #LoveTheNeighbor
"I only helped one person so far, and it happened to be on my birthday. It was the most amazing experience and I think it‚Äôs great that we can use technology to make people‚Äôs lives easier."
"Compassion at it‚Äôs best. Apart from the help for the blind. To this day I haven‚Äôt been consciously grateful for something, until used for others is overwhelmingly humbling, resulting in real and instant happiness & gratification. The app works great. If anything I wish To be utilized more often."
"I believe as humans deep down we all want to help each other, and be connected. I am so thankful for this app and for all those who use it! I just got my first call to assist today, and it was so easy to use and help. Everyone should have this installed on their phone!"
"This app seems like it is really revolutionary and helpful. As someone wanting to help, I would love to do this, but I wish there was an ability to schedule my available times. Getting a call while in the car, or at work isn‚Äôt great. It would be much better if I could set my availability for when I‚Äôm at home doing nothing."
"After using Be My Eyes for a couple of years now, I have to say this is a prime example of technology being used for good. It feels incredible to help someone with a task so simple yet challenging for them to do on their own. I look forward to incoming calls from Be My Eyes every day!"
"Just simply amazing. I‚Äôve gotten one call so far , and I‚Äôve missed a couple now and it makes me so sad when I don‚Äôt get it in time!! I really hope I continue to get calls and can get another one very soon!"
"I‚Äôve helped lots of older folks with poor or no vision with little things around their home, like reading the labels on cleaning products so they know which one to use. 10/10 interactions with some sweet people. It‚Äôs a privilege to help."
"Nothing better than being able to help someone in the spot, when they need it.  It‚Äôs my favorite calls to receive and wish I got more!"
"I got to answer my first call yesterday and it‚Äôs really heart filling! Although I‚Äôm only slightly visually  impaired & not blind, I really enjoy sharing my vision. It‚Äôs really a sweet feeling when you know you actually helped someone and it‚Äôs so humbling  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This app changes lives. Not only does it help give blind people the opportunity to see without feeling like a burden, it gives others a chance to feel helpful and together there‚Äôs a special connection the world needs."
If only I had more time to connect with this sweet woman.  She called in the middle of a busy work day and asked me to describe the colors and pattern of her dress.  Then we got to go into her closet and pick out shoes.  It was such fun! I know she will look beautiful in her silver flats :). Loved everything about the experience.
Idk if it‚Äôs good yet bc I‚Äôm downloading it rn qnd Troye recommends it so it must be good. Plus I just think that this is an amazing and useful idea in general so even if the app has some issues when I use it I know that there is at least someone out there that can be helped through this app.
Thank you for creating a place where people can connect to help one another. I wish I would have found the app when it first started.. I find myself patiently waiting for the next time a request is sent.
What a wonderful concept. Very easy to download the app and get set up. I had my first call and wow how amazing it was that I could be of service to someone in another state/ time zone. I would definitely recommend my friends and family to sign up and be of service.
"I‚Äôve now gotten to help 3 people with things like ‚ÄúWhat Color is the button glowing?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is the Up arrow on the keyboard?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI got turned around and am lost can you tell me if the railing is behind me or in front of me?‚Äù 

Very thankful I can help someone in need, somewhere in the world!!"
"I had the opportunity to be contacted and assist with vitamin identification, and settings on the washing machine.  
We had a very nice conversation about family histories and even shared our love of cultural foods!   A great experience and looking forward to assisting again!"
"I am so happy to be a volunteer with
 ‚ÄúBe my eyes‚Äù
It is a joy to answer the phone and be of assistance. It is an easy app to use and I believe those requesting assistance are finding it helpful as well. I want to thank the creators and all participants. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
You don‚Äôt realize the minute you get the call who‚Äôs gonna change the day you or the caller. I have cried after hanging up so many times. From the LOVE that is truly shared with each call!  I wish they‚Äôd call more!!! üíïüíØ
"I am a volunteer in this app.  I find this app very good and I am very happy to help people. But there is a small problem that the video chat is a bit blurry, making it difficult for me and other volunteers to see the items/things. Hope you can fix. Thanks"
I recently helped a blind couple find where to spray for ants they were having a problem with. It genuinely made my day to be of service to them... what an ingenious way to help! Thank you for providing such a platform to do so.
Got the app and waited for a while and I got my first call. I helped someone turn on the ac since it was hot in their house and they felt dizzy. Felt great. Easy call and was glad and humbled to be able to help want your own story? Volunteer today!
This app has purpose and  is gives you an opportunity to be of service to others when they need it most!
"Cool app, got my first call a few weeks ago, the man just wanted me to read off his lotto ticket numbers. He couldn‚Äôt hear well but he was able to eventually hear me read his number. Quality is a little grainy but it was a wholesome experience"
This app is so cool to me that anyone anywhere can help anyone somewhere else through their phone. I‚Äôve answered 2 calls now and it the most exciting thing. It brightened my day more than anyone else‚Äôs and I highly recommend this app.
"I downloaded this app last spring. Tonight was the first time I was connected with someone who needed my eyes (They alert several volunteers, and the first to answer gets connected)! I love being able to help a stranger, and think this is a lovely way to do that."
"We desperately need more apps of this nature/category than we do of any others. No matter your politics, no one should fall through the cracks of this too often difficult world."
I downloaded this app after seeing a video about it on Facebook. I got my first call the day after and was able to help someone choose a tie that matched their jacket. Such an awesome experience and very easy to use the app! I have recommended it to a bunch of people!
"I signed up as a volunteer and my first exchange with a blind user made me so happy. It feels so good to do something for someone else that only takes a couple moments. It‚Äôs so easy to do, they hear your voice and you see through their camera. 100% recommend."
"I, as a blind user, was hooked from the word go! Another IOS user had shown me how this worked, and I didn‚Äôt have an IOS device yet. Once I did, this was one of the first apps I installed! For sighted individuals, you would love volunteering for this, and for blind users, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
"I‚Äôve been using this app for over a year and every time I get a call I get very excited, people are so nice and it is a great way to help while being in your home."
"Amazing use of technology, just such a good idea that is so easy to use, it takes under a minute to answer a call usually but you could be making someone‚Äôs day! 
Highly recommend"
Makes you realize how the small things are important. Humbles you real quick! Love being able to help. I shared with family and friends. This concept is amazing
"What a wonderful app!! Even though there are way more people to help than there are people who NEED help, I‚Äôve gotten 2 calls in the past year! It‚Äôs rewarding to be able to help someone complete a task that sighted people take for granted. I LOVE this app."
"I love being able to help and this app makes it sooooo easy to do so. Seamless functionality, easy to set up and use, which makes for a great experience. Download, sign up, and get started today!"
Just what you would hope can be done with today‚Äôs technology to help others! You won‚Äôt be ‚Äòbothered‚Äô (not that it‚Äôs a bother!!) often with many more ‚Äòhelpers‚Äô available than ‚Äòrequesters‚Äô! So help out! ^.^
"The app works well and it feels so good to be able to provide help when someone needs it, without any of the awkwardness which would often accompany such a request.  Thank you for creating such a useful and thoughtful app."
I can‚Äôt rate this app high enough. This a genius way to connect people around the world and assist the visually impaired with tasks. It took a few minutes to set up and I received my first call within a day. This app has no strings attached and it‚Äôs just here to help. It‚Äôs perfect.
This is a truly remarkable way to use technology and help people serve one another daily in all the best ways. I marvel that it exists and is such a pure and kind way to make lives just a little bit better for everyone involved in the process.
I love helping people and this just makes it so much easier to help with those little things that the blind or vision impaired people struggle with literally at the touch of a button! Amazing!
Absolutely love helping people through this help. One of the most rewarding things I do. Thankful for something like this! Wish there were more calls to answer. I don‚Äôt get them frequent enough.
"I absolutely love this app. I use it several times a week. I could not have gotten along without it during the pandemic, especially. It is an affirmation of the world community! Many thanks to all of the volunteers."
If you are looking for help for a loved one that is blind this app is perfect there really no other way I can describe it. It was so help full for my aunt and all she had to do is call them and they would help her with anything
I am some one in school so I just wish there was a way that you can make it so there is a time no one can have a chance to call you so you don‚Äôt have to let anyone down
I needed to read the label on a very tiny little bottle. I am totally blind so there was no way I could find out what it said. I got a very nice young lady who helped me very quickly and gave me the information I needed. I was so excited I could hardly stand it.
"I‚Äôm not a visually impaired person, I love this app because it allows me to use my eyes and technology to help make another person‚Äôs day better. I can‚Äôt think of a better use for technology and smart phones than this application!"
"Absolutely love this!
With so many people attached to electronics today, this is a wonderful way to make the very best use of it!
Being able to help someone in this way when they need it is a great thing for all persons involved!
I am proud to be a part of this!"
This app is awesome! It is so easy to help someone who needs it. It notifies you when someone is calling and as soon as you answer you can see what the caller is pointing their phone at. I love being able to help people when needed.
"I just got my first call to help someone and I am so absolutely happy about this app, it‚Äôs a wonderful way to help people when in need and the fact that I can turn on their flashlight helped a lot! I‚Äôm glad that I downloaded and was able to help"
I just answered my first call and I was so glad I could help the gentleman. I seriously cried after because how happy I was that I could help him and I can‚Äôt wait to answer another all! This is such a brilliant idea and I really hope to see similar apps in the future
"I have been using this app for over a year now and it‚Äôs been really helpful. No freezing, great UI, no annoying bugs so far. 
Great app/product.

Thank you."
Had my second call today. An amazing feeling being able to be there for someone who needs a second pair of eyes. Everyone should have this on their phone!
"I need more than 5 seconds to answer a call! I cannot tell you how many calls I have missed‚Äî- it‚Äôs very frustrating!

Again, I opened the message within seconds, yet someone else answered before me. Does your algorithm contact multiple people at the same time? It‚Äôs really not fair‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like playing the lottery- odds are against me!"
I just took my first call and it was awesome! I helped a woman read the price tags on a couple different bags and described the colors of the bags to her. She was super sweet and I had the best experience! I will never hesitate to answer another call!
"I finally completed my first call and it was an awesome experience!! Costs you nothing, just a few moments to help someone complete a task. The call was very clear and I can‚Äôt wait to complete more!"
I waited about a month to get my first call but it was so worth it to be able to help someone in their time of need! Highly recommending was very uplifting and I hope more people find out about it.
"I had my first call came all the way from England 
She didn‚Äôt necessarily need help at the moment, she was just checking out the app. 
We had a beautiful conversation and told each other to have a great day. 

I live in Florida. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Amazing and user friendly app. My husband introduced me to it and it coincided with The Great Kindness Challenge week at work. I‚Äôm spreading the word and hope we all continue to spread acts of kindness everyday. Thank you to the people behind this app for reminding the world we are all important #InclusionMatters
"Thank you for creating this app and giving me the opportunity to provide service to the community. As a busy professional, I don't often have time to ‚Äúgo volunteer‚Äù but can easily help through Be My Eyes!"
"I just had my first interaction with a visually impaired person, and I‚Äôm so happy I was able to help them even in a small way! They asked for help reading a screen. The call lasted no longer than a minute, but it feels great to help someone, no matter how small."
"My first call, I was literally jumping for joy. I was so excited to finally be able to connect and help someone. It was such a simple task, like reading spices in a spice rack for her but she was so happy to have help at her fingertips to help prepare her dinner!"
This is such a neat way to be able to help people. I am so excited whenever someone uses this to ask for help. It‚Äôs a great way to give back. I have a daughter who is visually impaired and I am thrilled to be part of this.
"This is such an amazing app. I have helped a total of 5 people so far this year. I am glad I can be of assistance for some of the daily life things that those of us that have no vision barriers may take for granted daily. 
Amazing app!"
I love answering calls and being of service to folks. I‚Äôve taken calls like ‚Äúhelp me find the can of tomatoes in the pantry‚Äù or ‚Äúwhich pair of shoes goes best with my outfit‚Äù.  Simple ways to be kind to someone else. Love it!
I heard about it from a friend who had never got a call before and I got a call my second day! Expected it to be a little awkward but it wasn‚Äôt at all. Helped someone read their thermostat and it was super easy and quick
"Well, it‚Äôs a beautiful app that you never seen your life. I hope you love it and I hope you enjoy it. Once again remind your seen in your whole life. Once again be in my eyes you‚Äôre the greatest. Every app you make is the greatest app. I love your apps."
I‚Äôm seeing reviews of people giving one star to this app not because the app is flawed but because they don‚Äôt get a call within a month it literally warns you about that just wanted to give it some more good reviews and not a bad one
"This morning i woke up to helping a blind person. And i feel really really blessed to be able to help him. It has been such a beautiful experience, my whole mood is brightened today as i feel very happy to have helped someone in need."
"I had my first call today and was able to help someone, not only did it feel great to help but they world we live in today with technology is phenomenal. Whoever thought of this app is a kind person and amazing person!"
Since everyone‚Äôs always looking at your phone anyways I think everyone should have this. It‚Äôs great that they made this for to be able to help someone out that doesn‚Äôt have the ability of sight.
I started using this app recently as a volunteer and I believe it's one of the greatest apps on the App Store. It allows you to help others in need anytime and anywhere. God bless the creators of this app for this wonderful service they've provided for those who really need it!
"It just feels so good to help people, its not strainful tasks they will usually just ask for help with reading something or telling them a color, but it feels so rewarding to help them. 100% recommend."
I‚Äôve been signed up for just over 3 months now and I have answered 3 calls. Feels nice to be able to help.  All have asked for some simple task that most of us take for granted. Grateful to help out.
"Just had my first call today to help someone who is visually impaired via ""Be My Eyes"". There are so many volunteers on the app, I never thought my help would be needed, but oh my heart I loved being able to help. ü•∞"
I love every call I receive because you deal with different people. The people are so nice and understanding. Just be quick when the call come in or it‚Äôll go to someone else.
"Please support the app. I really enjoy being helpful to someone in need, and thanks to the app I can solve a small portion of issues a blind person deal with on daily basis. Thank you guys for letting us experiencing this great feeling. üí™üèªüí™üèª"
This is such a great way to help your fellow man or woman. It is easy. You just have to to answer the questions that are asked and maybe have the person adjust the camera. It is really rewarding. Try it!
I missed my first call because i was on my phone and it only gave me a few seconds and I literally cried for an hour cause I didn‚Äôt help them but it would be so much better if it gave me more than a few seconds üôÉ
I never get notifications if someone is calling. i‚Äôve had the app for about three months now and i‚Äôve gotten one notification about someone calling. I don‚Äôt even get the option to help someone. I love the idea and I think it‚Äôs great but i‚Äôd like to get the option to help :/
I answered a call and was able to help 2 people at once. I was also able to turn the light on for the caller‚Äôs phone! (There‚Äôs an icon on the bottom of the screen.). Great way to use technology to help others.
"I started volunteering last month and received today my first call. 
I‚Äôm so happy because a little help from everyone can mean a lot for other people. 
Thank you be my eyes for making my day better. I‚Äôm happy to help!"
"My first experience with Be My Eyes came when I answered a call for assistance from the Netherlands! I helped a gentleman select a specific tea bag from a large assortment. It was amazing! When I told my friends and family about my experience, I had tears of joy in my eyes."
So far I‚Äôve been able to help several people through this app. Lots of good karma :) The only thing I can think of that would be nice to add would be the ability to zoom in to whatever the camera is focused on.
I got my first call today and I only signed up yesterday! It was seriously the most amazing thing to be a part of. Im on such a high from it! The most amazing app invention there is. Kudos to the creators. I am sharing this with EVERYONE!
"Having lived with a grandmother, mother and uncle who experienced the gradual onset of blindness due to macular degeneration I find a simple blessing in being able to help others through this app.  I get excited each time it rings!"
Answered a call for the first time and I know I was helping the gentleman calling but man did this actually help me. The power of helping others is such a joy and so beautiful.
Being a volunteer for be my eyes is so fulfilling. I love being able to help someone in need and not do it just because I‚Äôm getting paid. Best volunteer work ever. The only downside is I wish I got more calls.
"I wish more blind people have access to this app! I have been answering calls for 2 years, helping the visually impaired find items, confirm documents, even read lotto tickets. Please spread the word!"
Glad to be part of the Be My Eyes volunteer community. This app is a simple yet ingenious way for those people with vision challenges or sight loss to get assistance quickly with everyday tasks.
"So thrilled to be a volunteer with Be My Eyes! I have assisted in 2 calls, no matter how many, I feel I am making a difference if I helped just 2 individuals! What an awesome idea and service being a volunteer to assist the seeing impaired ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è"
"Just got my first call today, and it was pretty cool to help out, had a huge smile afterwards, and can‚Äôt wait to get another call! Been waiting for 3 years to be fast enough to answer a call lol!"
I don‚Äôt even know where to start. This app is a God Send. Just knowing you are helping in the slightest way is truly moving. Appreciate the creators for bringing a great app and making a difference! Recommend to the fullest!
I work for myself at home so I‚Äôm able to answer calls during the work day. Great way to spend a few moments helping other person. Highly recommend.
"Love that I can be here to help anyone who may need anything at any time from anywhere. Because it‚Äôs so easy to use, I can easily sign other people up which is awesome also."
Unfortunately I‚Äôve had 4 calls and not a single one made a connection. I‚Äôve been wanting to meet and help whomever called. As a matter of fact I get ambitious whenever a call comes through and then it fails and I get so frustrated and  upset and tv he more it happens the heavier the guilt lay.
Big thank you to the people who created this app! I seen this shared on Facebook and never downloaded something so fast! Also not to mention this is my first review! Much love for everyone who wants to do this and I hope we see more things like this! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"As soon as I saw this app I knew I wanted to be a part of it. The chance to help people and do something good for somebody, anywhere, anytime of day. I‚Äôve been looking at more apps that are similar, but there‚Äôs not many especially like this one. I love it!"
Being able to do what I can when someone else could use a set of eyes for a moment is great! Everyone should try it. I‚Äôd love to help all day long if I had time! So satisfying and meaningful. I‚Äôve got a buzz from helping a stranger! Great convo.
"This app is an amazing tool for people with low or no vision. As a volunteer and mother of a child who is totally blind, I think this app has given me as much as it gives the blind people using it. To see how many people have volunteered to help others is incredible."
I have had two calls in 3+ months. I helped with one. The woman had trouble reading can labels. I helped her find tomatoes and chili mix. It took less than a minute. Simple acts of kindness to strangers. If you are reading this just install it and do your part.
Had my very first call today after installing this app months ago. It went perfectly and it made my day knowing I helped someone in need.  Excited for the next call.
"As a sighted person, if you have the chance to use this app even once to help someone who is blind you‚Äôll never be the same again. This is truly life changing technology and it will give you such a meaningful way to help. Hats off."
Getting these calls and being able to help people makes my day everytime!
"It was great, I recently got my first call after two years of being a member, it made me very happy that doing something as simple as reading the chlorine amount and ph of someone‚Äôs pool helped them so much, great app"
"After being BME volunteer for a long time, I finally got my first call for assistance. It literally made me realize how much we take the littlest things for granted, like a greeting card."
I‚Äôve had the app for 4 months and just received my first call! It was amazing and totally recommend everyone to get this app! Super easy to answer the call and help someone :)
Each and every time I get a call I am incredibly humbled and extremely grateful for the gift of site that we all take for granted daily. I am honored to be able to help someone with a daily task.
This app is such a rewarding fulfilling opportunity to simply do something for someone you‚Äôve never met! I‚Äôve waited so long for my first call I missed 2 before this but I won‚Äôt ever miss another one ‚ù§Ô∏è
It is not about you. Also this app is amazing it‚Äôs a great app to help people I haven‚Äôt gotten a call yet but it‚Äôs amazing to think that I could help people so easily.
"i use the app as a low-vision person. i think it‚Äôs great and easy to use. the only things i would change is maybe i would want to see the name of the person i‚Äôm talking to, or maybe an optional feature to call/request someone i‚Äôve already talked to before?? that way it could be a little more personal i think. and i would really like an option to use the front facing camera. otherwise i think it‚Äôs pretty much perfect and i will definitely continue to use it in the future."
"I cried after my first phone call! I never heard that ringtone so when I saw it was Be My Eyes, I was excited! I didn‚Äôt care that I was woken up out of my sleep! I helped a young lady make brownies! It was fun and we were laughing!"
What a way to feel helpful and to be able to give time to another. I had my first call last month and what a joy it was to help out a complete stranger who lived 1500 miles away. Thank you to the creators of Be My Eyes!! üíïüíïüíï
"I helped my first person ever today on this app. I helped him read who his mail was from, and what the letter said. It was sooo rewarding. Recommend this app 100% for the blind and for those who are not. Take 10 mins out of your day to help someone in need"
"I thought it would be a fantastic way to lend my eyes. It says it takes awhile to get your first call which is understandable. But now I see why it takes so long. The home screen just spins and spins, never loads. Haven‚Äôt seen it load since I first got the app. After that, never loaded again. The ‚Äúnews‚Äù section is just fine. Guess lll delete and maybe try again some other time but right now, it‚Äôs just taking up space."
I cannot tell you how excited I got just now when my phone rang to help someone after downloading the app around six months ago. It was a lady who got some beauty items from a food pantry. üíó
I never stop to rate an app- however this is different! This app is amazing and kudos to whomever came up with it! I have had 3 calls and loved helping every time! Even my kids get excited when it rings! Such an amazing and helpful app!
"I love having this opportunity and it‚Äôs very easy to use!  If I could change anything, it would be to have more opportunities and hear my phone ring more often.  There are times that I don‚Äôt get a call for months, and I wonder how the calls are metered and directed."
I received my first call the other day and I got the opportunity to walk someone through making sure they were taking the right medication. So neat to be able to help someone like this! Whoever thought this up is a genius!
"I‚Äôm so happy to be able to help in any way, millions of people on this app and I miss calls to quicker clickers all the time! Haha I‚Äôm just glad they are helped, defiantly download if you have a few minutes to help every few months."
Not a problem with app itself but lost the call because the caller ‚Äúbackgrounded‚Äù the app when an incoming call came in.  They weren‚Äôt sure how to get the video back on even though I could still hear them.
"This is an amazing idea and I truly appreciate its function to not only empower individuals, but perhaps more importantly by connecting people in meaningful and positive ways.  

Thank you to all those involved that brought something special into the world."
"I love this app. What a gift to be offered a chance to help someone in need. Sure the request may seem mundane, read this label for me, yet to the person in need it is everything.

Thank you."
Love being able to help someone in need- have been able to help 2 people now with reading something and picking clothes to match - so glad to help and can‚Äôt wait to help some more - AMAZING app idea :)
"It was amazing!  All they wanted was for me to tell them what they had picked out of the freezer, but it thrilled me to be able to do that.  I can‚Äôt wait for my next call!"
Many of us who have those in our lives with low to no vision understand how important it is to be there for our loved ones. With this app we can now help the world. Thanks
I‚Äôve been a member for 9 months and only received one call but that one call meant everything. It was a good feeling knowing you are helping someone out
"Love this idea.  And love this app.  I wish I was called more, because it‚Äôs so cool and great to be able to help.  But happy when I do get calls.   Issues sometimes with video quality, but it generally works well"
"I received my first call maybe a month ago & it was the most humbling experience ever. I look forward to more calls. A society where we help each other succeed is always winning üòÅ 

I would rate 10 stars."
"For someone who is busy and doesn‚Äôt always have time to go volunteer, be my eyes is perfect! It‚Äôs so rewarding to help other humans with tasks that is sighted people take for granted. I‚Äôm so glad I found this app and am able to help people around the world!"
"This app is amazing, I don‚Äôt need to service but I‚Äôm am glad to be of service to those who do. Their are more volunteers then blind people registered and it gives me a little more hope in humanity because of it."
"In 45 seconds, I helped someone choose between options during a life-activity. It was a fantastic experience and a wonderful way to USE tech to BE human! This is a mutually rewarding, and heartwarming, quick-fix! I love this app! THANK YOU BME, for making it!"
I‚Äôm not visually impaired but I am volunteering as a seeing person. I just took my first call to help a woman cross a very busy road. It was great knowing I could help her and it was scary to see that she was there alone. I felt good knowing she made it across safely.
It such an effortless way to help someone in need. I‚Äôve received two calls each taking maybe 5 mins tops of my time. Yet still I was able to help someone in a big way.
"I just assisted someone who was impaired. She had 3 bottles of spray cans. Purple spray paint, white spray paint and chlorinated parts cleaner spray. I helped identify which 2 were actual spray paints and which was a parts cleaner. Awesome way to help people who may not have received the assistance without this app!! Awesome idea!!"
It is so hard to help someone! As you get calls in the complete dark... it would help if the app automatically turned on the flashlight or
I found this app from Reddit and downloaded it only to help a person pick out a complimentary outfit. Look forward to connecting with another person soon.
"A simple, user-friendly, brilliant app that is making a meaningful difference. I‚Äôll never forget the first call I answered and the joy I felt in being able to help someone out."
Never heard of this app until last week. Got my first call today. Was so happy to see how happy the young man was when I was able to help him out. God has blessed me with my eyesight and I‚Äôm happy I can help someone that can‚Äôt see or color blind.
"Just joined the group of volunteers for this app. Everything looks good, but the problem was the home page never seems to load. Tried closing the app and coming back in, but the problem remains the same. Odd. Please fix this guys"
I‚Äôve only answered two calls since I joined but both times I felt great about helping the callers. Just a minute or two of my time makes another person‚Äôs day a bit easier.
Love being a volunteer. Very fun meeting new people. One time I got a fluke call from another volunteer and when I went to report it I couldn‚Äôt write in any details about what happened so I wanted to try to reach out. Thanks for being here!
"Outstanding service! I‚Äôm so grateful to be a part of it. Simple, well designed app that works the way it‚Äôs suppose to, but the impact it has on peoples lives cannot be understated. 10/10 would recommend."
Today I was able to help a visually impaired woman with her grocery shopping. I was able to read labels for her and tell her prices. It was a fantastic experience and she was so appreciative. Kudos to the mastermind behind this app
"I answered my first call as a volunteer about a week after joining and it was very straightforward. This is a great solution and the developers have really leveraged technology to help people. If only all developers kept this in mind.

Signed,
a developer"
"If you are blind and need help with everyday tasks, then this is the app for you. There are over a million sighted volunteers just waiting to help you in multiple different languages! If you are a sighted volunteer, you should download this app and help blind people."
"I‚Äôm so glad I get to help people who are visually impaired. I get to meet people from all over the globe and make their day a little easier. This app is a great idea and I wish it much success, it truly does make life a lot easier for those who need it."
Where do I even begin?! This is so awesome! I had my first call finally! About 2 days after downloading the application. It is a wonderful feeling to be able to help and assist someone! I love this app!
So I downloaded the app yesterday and got my first call today! I was really excited to help out another person! I would definitely do that again üòä
Love this app and the concept! I‚Äôve had this app for a little over a year now and I‚Äôve only been able to answer 3 calls which is bitter sweet. I wish I answered in time for more. But I love this
"I was having trouble with my ipad & made a appointment at my local Apple Store in Boca Raton, FL for the genius bar. The employee who was assisting me told me about Be My Eyes while my ipad was rebooting. I was blown away & so moved I downloaded immediately."
Got my first call yesterday. My life is better for it. I have no interaction with the visually impaired in my normal life. I learned so much in those 2 minutes. Looking forward to the next one.
"Get help if you need, be help if you can.
Got my first call yesterday. Made my day. Took a few months but worth it to have on your phone. Be a part of a better world"
I‚Äôve been able to help a few times. Great app. The connection is steady and I‚Äôm glad folks can be connected together and make life easier for each other. Easy to sign up and help.
I have signed up to be a volunteer and was able to take a call. The gentleman was very polite and friendly. I helped with color and audio equipment which is right up my alley(Tv and audio). I look forward to the next call‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç
"I got my first call and it was to help someone pick which load type they needed to put their laundry in. A small 30 second call made a difference in someone‚Äôs life, and that‚Äôs amazing."
"I love how easy it is to help someone. Every time I answer a call, the person on the other line is extremely appreciative.  This app was a great idea! I would, however, like to know more about how the app works for the visually impaired person‚Äôs perspective."
I love how this app makes it easy for sighted and for non-sighted people to connect. I have been privileged to help several folks with their thermostat level and counting dollar bills. Keep up the great work with this app!!!
"I believe that the be my eyes is absolutely wonderful. I have only gotten one call but it was so special. I felt so good about it and I‚Äôm sure they were grateful. Thank you for creating this app and letting so many people help others in need. 

-Brooklyn"
"So far I‚Äôve answered 4 calls. There was only 1 I couldn‚Äôt help (hooking up an Apple TV, because I couldn‚Äôt get the camera to be where I needed it). I want people to know that they shouldn‚Äôt even hesitate to use this app. We are here!"
"I just received my first call and was able to assist. 
I was nervous but the call went well. It was completed in just a couple of minutes. 

So glad I found this App!"
I had my first call today and I am tickled pink! Absolutely wonderful to have something available like this for those who need it
I am very thankful for this app thank you for the creators and all the volunteers could not done without you keep up the great work in behalf of all the visual impaired people in the world thanks again Godspeed
There is simply no way to measure the amount of good you can do by making someone else‚Äôs day better. This app makes that possible. I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful to be a part of the ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù community.
"This app has truly warmed my heart in so many different ways! I love getting calls from new people. I love getting the chance to help them and speak to them a little! And I love the appreciation they have for something so small!!! Best App, hands down!!!!"
"I am a BME volunteer and all I can say is...Wow. It‚Äôs such an awesome service that they are providing to people around the world. I never have a technical issue with the app, so I am able to help the calls that come through with ease. I am so humbled to be part of this!"
This is amazing. I feel so honored to be able to help with the simple things in life like doing the laundry. The app works well and is very easy to use. Can‚Äôt wait until my next call!
This is exactly the kind of app I love seeing/using. Making helping people easy is exactly what technology should be used for. The calls are easy and the people are friendly.
"Super easy to use. Things as simple as reading authorization codes, confirming the difference between vitamin bottles, or making sure the person in need has the right color pen for their checkbook."
I feel there is nothing better than being able to help someone especially no matter where you are and no matter where they are. This app is just absolutely awesome
"Whoever thought about this brilliant app was a genius, and I can‚Äôt think of a better way to help someone in need. I just gotten my first call that I didn‚Äôt miss yesterday and it felt so good knowing I was able to assist her and her child."
This app is so rewarding.  My daughter and I enjoyed this app together.  She is dyslexic and it was a great way to encourage her to read more in a positive manner.  She feels great after a call and so do I.  Thank you for everything.
This app is such a cool idea and fills a much needed gap. I just wish it would limit the amount of volunteers so there was a more equal ratio of volunteers to people needing help. Or perhaps introduce another way for all these volunteers to help so that we are being utilized more!
"This app makes me feel good to be able to help those in need. I don‚Äôt get a ton of calls, but when I do, I stop what I‚Äôm doing to engage a visually impaired person complete a task. Everybody needs somebody."
I think this app is wonderful. It really shows the beauty and compassion in all humans. I want everyone to feel included no matter what and this app helps do just that. Thank you Be My Eyes!
"Today was the first day that I got to help someone, and it was such a cool experience. It doesn‚Äôt cost anything, to help someone in need. Thank you to whoever made this app, you‚Äôre doing an amazing thing."
"I just finished my second ""Be My Eyes"" call as a volunteer.  It was the most amazing and beautiful experience to be able to help someone with this app.  A deep gratitude to the developers."
Thank you for developing such a brilliant app. I had my first call today and I was helped just as much as the visually impaired person I assisted. This is the mental health pick-me-up 2020 needs!
I LOVE that this app gives me the opportunity to help someone. I‚Äôve taken one call so far and I‚Äôve only had the app for a day. We were successful in the task that he needed me for!! It made my day!
"Since joining over one year ago, I have had the pleasure of assisting only one person. Other than times of being unavailable, when I even attempt to answer a call by immediately pressing answer another volunteer intercepts the call.  Leaving me disappointed and feeling useless."
Easy to use I just wish it was more often. I love helping others and it helps you understand how we take even little things for granted.
"This is the best app! I have been able to assist quite a few people. I help with anything from finding a CD, checking to see if the washer is empty, or reading the expiration date on a package. It makes me feel good to be of service."
The simplicity with which the app operates makes it feel like no more a disturbance of a tap on the shoulder when someone wants to ask you something. Excellent job making this workflow frictionless.
This app makes it so much easier to reach out for help. We all get stuck in our day-to-day lives and I can only imagine how much of a peace of mind this app provides to the blind in our community. Best app on my phone.
"What may be trivial for you can be a true challenge for another person.  And visa versa. This app is an easy way to help someone, and will make you feel good long after the call for assistance.  Never take anything for granted."
"This is the most heartwarming app. It makes me feel happy to be on the helping end of a phone call. The ratio of people who need help versus helpers is uneven, so I have only gotten one call so far in one month. I can‚Äôt wait for more to come."
"This app allows you to commit random acts of kindness! I‚Äôve been able to answer a couple calls, and it‚Äôs great to know that people who are blind or visually impaired have access to quick help at the touch of a screen."
Amazing app!! I rarely get through to a person in need because the call normally gets answered by another sighted person before me (which is a good thing for users!) but when I do get to help a person who is blind it is so awesome!! Such a great idea!!
I was able to turn on flashlight on the person‚Äôs from a button in the app. Which was really helpful! Simple and straightforward features.
"It‚Äôs my honor to be standing by, on call to help out someone who needs me. I‚Äôve helped several people choose shirt colors, determine canned goods, locate a counter command, and much more. And each time it‚Äôs a pleasure to help. üíú"
Easily the most important app on my phone. Nothing makes my day like getting one of these calls and being able to help someone else.
I love helping the visually impaired and also it is really fun and at the same time makes me feel better about being able to assist others
"Really simple way to connect people with timely solutions to every day questions. As a volunteer, it‚Äôs a straightforward way to help without having to schedule or coordinate a thing."
Totally great. Makes it super easy to be of help to someone with visual impairment. Only wish there were more apps like this that lets us connect and help each other in meaningful ways.
Helped someone see their screen to back up their computer. Took literally five minutes of my day and was really rewarding. Hope to be able to help more people in the future.
Got my first call tonight and I was so glad to be of help to a man who needed me. As a person who sees we get so caught up in not realizing that we can do anything but a simple call that we answer really changes someone‚Äôs day! This app is really great!
I have had several calls to be able to help.  I love being able to be someone‚Äôs eyes and help with a simple task that could be overwhelming for someone else.  I only wish I got more calls to help.
"Every time I look at the app it tells me I‚Äôve been logged out even though I‚Äôve kept it open. If it keeps doing this I‚Äôll resign. There is no way to help someone if the app signs you out constantly. It‚Äôs a brilliant idea. And having poor vision though, correctable by glasses myself, this is important to me. I really want to help but this log out issue is very frustrating."
I signed up as a volunteer for this app. What a wonderful platform to assist the visually impaired! I‚Äôve only assisted two callers in the year I‚Äôve had it downloaded but usually get a call a month or so.
Just helped a blind person for 2min to identify some bills. Such small effort on my side but made my day to help someone. Smooth process on the app. Please sign up and join the community!
I am a visually impaired person and I keep calling but nobody answers my calls and also when I click on the specialised help everything is close this app is stupid and never helps with anything and why the age is 17+ why cannot the kids this app is dumb and stupid stupid app this is my opinion I think this app must go away forever it won‚Äôt work and it won‚Äôt help any blind or visually impairment
I have been able to assist several people on the Be My Eyes app and it has been a great experience‚Ä¶ And very rewarding knowing that I have been helping other people.
I feel like this is the most beneficial to anyone who cannot see. Every person has been so grateful for my help
Excited for this app and thank goodness for it I am a Volunteer and I am glad that someone has made this app!! I haven‚Äôt received my first call yet but I can‚Äôt wait to assist and help someone:)
"I understand that there is a lot of helpers compared to blind people that isn‚Äôt necessarily there fault but I don‚Äôt like it because I didn‚Äôt sign up to have an app sit on my phone and never go to use. As of right now if you download it, chances are you won‚Äôt be getting a call any time soon. But the bright side is that everyone of the blind with this app is getting help"
I just wish I was able to assist.   With the number of helpers to the number of vision impaired it‚Äôs hard to even get a call. Hopefully this picks up to assist those in need!
Thankyou for the opportunity to be of service. Just got my first call from a traveling executive who wanted to be sure he was using shampoo and not conditioner. Great guy.
Be My Eyes makes it easy to lend a helping hand to others! What a joy to spend just a few moments to offer assistance that can really make another person‚Äôs day!
I have been able to help some on this app and it is nice to help a stranger when I can. This app is a great idea and I hope others hear about it and use it.
"From the settings on someone‚Äôs washing machine to whether a bottle was baby lotion or shampoo, it‚Äôs such an easy way to help out.  My most complex one was a lost guy looking for a business, but I could see a good samaritan and he made it with our powers combined!  Good stuff.  :)"
"It feels so good to be part of this community. I got my first call this evening and I don‚Äôt know who helped who more. What a joy it was to help someone do something that I take for granted. Everyone should have this app, do good and feel good!"
"Be My Eyes is a great example of tech for good. The app is stable and UI is totally unobtrusive. All the notifications I‚Äôve received are to help people in need of eyes, zero annoying notifications to see ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new‚Äù like most apps tend to do."
I discovered this app today from Bea Miller‚Äôs tweet about it and I have yet to answer a call but this is an amazing opportunity to feel like you can make a difference and help others. An amazing app for sure!
I signed up yesterday and just had my first call for help today. It was awesome to help someone. It really is the little things that we can do for someone in need. One person at a time.
"Just got my first call today, from someone who needed me to read through the steps of a computer update. It was easy for me, and he was happy for the help. What a win-win!"
I‚Äôve answered a handful of calls and I always have such a great time helping. It‚Äôs also a bonus that everyone is so kind on the other end.
"This app is awesome, I just downloaded the app yesterday and received my first call this morning. It is wholesome way to help others, adds a little brightness to your day as well as theirs!"
I‚Äôm a volunteer and I love the opportunity to help so easily. Technology at its best! It will be nice to define specific hours when I‚Äôm usually available. I absolutely love this app and tell everyone about it :)
I‚Äôm so happy that someone came up with this to help so many people who have lost their eyesight I really think will improve many people‚Äôs livesüíú
The first time I was able to assist a visually impaired person felt wonderful. I help them set their thermostat and let them know how and where the commands work. Little things that make a world of difference to someone.
Sadly I have only missed one call which is a bummer and am looking forward to actually helping. Really glad so many people are on this app so that everyone can provide assistance as needed.
"I am a volunteer, and I always get excellent picture & sound when ever I get the opportunity to help someone. 
This app is definitely life changing and it feels good to help someone in need. 
Keep the calls coming!"
The fact that I can help people who cannot see just by answering a call is amazing. I have not gotten my 1st call yet but i am anxious to. I usually spend time volunteering at the animal shelter which requires me to leave my home... this is GREAT!
What a great app! I heard about a friend who used it to help a blind person read what the temperature was in her house. I just helped someone who needed help resetting her satellite dish after a power failure.  This app is truly a great use of technology!
"I‚Äôve had this app for just about a year and recently received my first assistance request. 

The request came from an individual who needed to differentiate between two items. Assistance rendered and thumbs up!

In this instance it only required about two minutes of my time to assistant someone with something that without the benefit of sight would be impossible to differentiate.  

... and then I was back to watching TV. 

Take the time to download and volunteer!"
"Amazingly beautiful app.
Brilliant idea.
For all those who wish to help people with disabilities and don't know where or how to start, this app gives you the chance to do that.

I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"
"I can no longer receive calls because of some bug in the system.  I get a message that I have not given access to my microphone or camera.  I did enable it in the beginning, but when they did an update, it must have disabled it and it is no longer possible to reenable it.  I wrote BME about it and they said they were aware of he problem, but as far as I can tell, it has not been fixed"
This app is my fav! I‚Äôve been able to answer and help one person so far! I miss a call but it was good knowing someone else picked up and helped them!
This app opens the door to help those in need by simply giving a bit of your time.
"I love that it‚Äôs so easy to help others, and so rewarding! I ran a NYC eye clinic for over 30 years and now that I‚Äôm retired, I can still help others. Thank you to those that created this app."
"I love being able to help people, even when it‚Äôs telling someone who is blind what color a shirt it. It puts a smile on their face and if fills my heart with joy knowing I was able to help"
"But I got tired of answering and seeing ‚ÄúCall has been answered by another volunteer‚Äù. 
I have answered and helped several people with this app over the last two plus years. 
There are 4.3 million users vs. 244k visually impaired folks. Yeah, I think I‚Äôm done wasting space with this app. Goodbye"
"If you‚Äôre looking to volunteer some time to help other people, this is a great app. It‚Äôs easy to use and has helped me become a better communicator."
I love being an active participant in helping someone.  This app is extremely user friendly and connects you while respecting your privacy. It‚Äôs a great way to give back and I‚Äôm grateful to have the opportunity.
"This app is so simple, and yet it is a truly genius idea‚Äîjust help people see! Helping someone with visual impairment takes 2 seconds out of your day, but can make a huge difference in someone‚Äôs life. Be someone‚Äôs eyes!"
It‚Äôs Father‚Äôs Day. I only had the app for 24 hrs. And I got to tell this adorable blind couple that they were going to be grandparents when they asked me what a shirt said that their son sent them- it said ‚Äúgreat dads get promoted to Grandpas‚Äù truly an amazing moment!!
"After 4 months I just got my first call today, but I missed the call because the sound is so quiet! I wish there was a way to change the sound! I am looking forward to getting another call- I‚Äôm so bummed I missed this one!! :("
A beautiful example of people coming together to help one another. Thank you to the amazing people behind this app. I‚Äôm so grateful for this opportunity to help others.
This app provides such an incredible opportunity to connect with another person.  It‚Äôs such a great idea and couldn‚Äôt be easier to use and enjoy.  It always brings a smile to my face!
"It's a wonderful feeling to meet and help others from around the world. I'm so glad this app was created. 
The only issue I have with it is that the notification sound is so quiet, I sometimes miss opportunities to assist. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Today, I answered my 3rd call. A man needed help with colors while shopping, another needed help identifying colors of wires of a ceiling fan he was installing, and the last was trying to make a purchase at a vending machine.  Patience and clear communication is a must! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
I love being able to assist someone with my phone.  Such a beautiful concept and I look forward to using this for a long time.
"This is what humans are meant to do for one another! Only feedback I have is that I wasn't sure I was supposed to talk once I got connected, so a simple speech bubble of say hello would have been helpful for my first time."
I love helping people. This is a great way to do so! Love that it‚Äôs free! Have helped a handful in two years. May not be many but any help I have was worth it! Glad to have this app! Have shared with many people!
This app makes it really easy to help those that cannot see. Easy to answer calls and not a heavy lift.
"Great app
Great idea
Im just happy to be a member of this community and i hope to see a lot more of these apps, cause what is life without helping each other?"
"My first call went very well. I think this is a great way to volunteer and very helpful. I only wish I had more calls, it‚Äôs that fun. Keep up the good work!"
I love this! I‚Äôve had it for about a year and have done about 5 calls. The callers are very professional and helpful with getting me to help them.
I feel so blessed to help this amazing woman today all she wanted was descriptions of the items she bought from the grocery store... so glad I was able to grab the call..
"Being able to answer calls and, in real time, help someone is great. Getting to talk to/help a stranger literally makes my whole week"
I really like this app because it shows that your wanting to help someone in need my future sister in law showed it to me. It‚Äôs really a good app I would recommend you guys to download
I think that the idea of this app is Ana it I have had two phone calls and each time is says we get disconnected? Has this happen to anyone else? I have had the opportunity for a few months?
this app is AMAZING!! i just finished my second call and was able to help a blind person across the country with a very simple task of using their microwave. this app is really using tech to help the blind community. GET THIS APP!!
An easy way to volunteer from wherever you are and have a moment of connection with someone who could use your eyes! Always a treat to get a call! Easy to use!
"I've only had the opportunity to help one gentleman. I helped him start his dishwasher. I was so thrilled that I could help someone, I ran to my husband and told him. No better feeling than helping someone!"
I had a girl get a hold of me and we were doing really good and all the sudden the phone cut off. I had no way of contacting her back. Can‚Äôt you put in even just a redial feature even if you don‚Äôt show the phone number?
"I get so excited every time I answer a call! It‚Äôs a tiny part of your day, and you know you have your phone in your hand anyway. It‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs helping so many people."
"I have only had the fortune to answer one call, but I will never forget it! I hope to have the opportunity again!"
So exciting to receive the call from those who need help and very heartwarming to be able to assist in their daily lives.
"I love this, being able to help a perfect stranger at any point, we need more of this!! It helps someone else and brightens my day- helps us connect as human kind!"
Is simple and easy to use on both ends.
I downloaded this yesterday and already got my first call today. Super quick and easy to connect. Happy to help assist any way I can!
I absolutely love this app honestly I‚Äôm a volunteer and this literally brightens my day I will stay on the phone with someone for an hour to help them I don‚Äôt care. Whoever created this is angel!!
I‚Äôve been volunteering with this App for a couple of years now. Love being able to help someone from anywhere at anytime!
This app is life changing for people and I commend whoever created this app because this is what life should be about. Helping others and giving a hand when needed is what makes us human.
The only complaint I have about this app is that I wish I got more calls but that‚Äôs for completely selfish reason. I‚Äôm overjoyed when I get a call and can actually help someone.
I‚Äôve been contacted a few times and it‚Äôs so gratifying to know that with a simple call we can help by just looking to the screen and describe what we are seeing!!!
"An Algerian man called me and all I could see was ceiling. He told me he was bored. I informed him he was calling me using a blind App for assistance. He started asking personal questions about me. He got very excited that I was American. He told me he was from Algeria. I asked him one more time if he needed help. He asked why he had to be blind. At this point I hung up on him. 

He asked where I lived, my age, if I was married and if I had children."
"What a great app. I‚Äôve been able to share it with some friends who are legally blind, and one who has color blindness. It could help them out. 

Hope to one day answer a call and help out another!!"
"I love this app! It is a simple way for people to receive assistance, for others to give a moment kindness, and a great way to make connections with each other! I recommend the app to everyone!"
I have only answered two calls. Each call lasted less than three minutes. It's an easy way to help someone out. I'm glad to  be a volunteer.
"I love be my eyes, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd actually get any calls and yes sometimes it takes a month or two to get another but honestly every little call makes my day and I love knowing I helped someone!!"
"I‚Äôve used this as a volunteer. I missed one call, but had another and connected. It worked pretty flawlessly. I was able to help a man with a work issue he was sorting out. 

Such a great idea for an app."
What a wonderful feeling to help someone. Anyone can do this! Sharing this app with others will change the community for visually impaired people across the world. Thats pretty life changing in a huge way!
This app is amazing. I was able to activate a flashlight and read the thermometer to help a visually impaired person. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to make a small but significant difference in someone‚Äôs life.
There is something to be said for an app that genuinely makes you feel good. Thank you for making my night with one simple call from someone needing assistance.
"The great thing I love about this application is that it sorts everyone by region. So us Farsi speakers can use this app as well!
I helped someone today reading a CAPTCHA and it felt so good! I'm so emotional right now. I hope more Iranians get to know this app and use it more often.

"Absolutely amazing helpful, useful, thoughtful app. My dad has been legally blind all my life with Retina degeneration and I will be volunteering from now until this app isn‚Äôt here anymore. Thank you"
"Just had my first call‚Ä¶it was super easy to open, and assist the guy. Such a great feeling being able to help someone I don‚Äôt even know!‚ù§Ô∏è"
"When you get the chance to help someone, you will be blessed beyond measure."
I‚Äôm a volunteer and I just think this app is so wonderful! The people I have helped have been so kind and it is a privilege to be of service to them. Great work!
I love helping people and this app does exactly that. You help people in a most incredible way by helping them see what they can‚Äôt.
Great experience and opportunity to help the world of visually impaired people. Love helping people with the average day to day tasks and decisions. I hope this is still around when/if my eyes go!
It‚Äôs such a pleasure to be able to do something to help another fellow human in need. It takes just moments and can really help folks who are in a jam.
I've only taken three phone calls so far but it definitely makes me happy to be able to help. I'm legally blind but with correction I see almost 20/20. I know if I lost my sight I would want help.
An easy way to give back in a way that makes the day easier for others. Definitely starts your day off right. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I have only had two calls in the last month was super excited being so eager to help and the call never picked up I hit answer this has happened twice now on my only two calls I want to help but not sure why app won‚Äôt allow me
This app makes it easy to be kind and helpful to someone in need in a way that is meaningful and would not otherwise present itself. Great combination of technology and all that is good in this world.
I‚Äôve been able to help a few people in situations where my eyes really helped. Described a restaurant for a first time visitor. Helped a person get their computer updated
The set up is great! It doesn't ask for a major comment. It's nice to be able to spend a few minutes and help someone out person to person.
Downloaded this app a few days ago and received my first request for assistance.  We he person needed help reading her snail mail (who it was from).  So happy to help and this app made it so easy to do so.  Can‚Äôt wait for the next request.
Will never be able to say how much god this has done for everyone. If you help or if you need help. ‚ù§Ô∏è would give 10 üåü if I could.
Never fails how excited i get yo catch a call and help a beautiful lovely person . Some are quick hit and some want to chat a bit nevertheless im more than happy to help‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
I received my first call today. I am so very humbled. It was a blessing to be a blessing and have the ability to help someone. I look forward to being able to assist again. I am grateful!‚ù§Ô∏è
Simple to use and highly recommended.
I got my first call today and the lady was really nice she needed help with know which onion was which. It is very neat to help out other people when they can‚Äôt distinguish things from one another
I love that this app lets me lend a hand (or eye) to people who need it. Thai app doesn‚Äôt send unnecessary notifications or spam you and takes up very little space on my phone. There is no reason not to get it!
"Very upset with my first call. It‚Äôs sad to see people are downloading this and using it to play around. It‚Äôs sickening and just plain wrong! I downloaded the app 2 days ago and got my first call from a person who thought it was funny to to joke around. Please, please, please figure out a way to stop these calls! And yes, I did report the call."
"There should be more apps/ things available to help people from our community‚Äôs. We‚Äôre all human, we all should bond together and progress. I believe with this app we have a start!"
"I recently received my first request for help. A simple task, helping a very nice lady who was having trouble telling the difference between two bottles of spice while cooking. Something we often take for granted. 
The call took a bit longer than it needed because we chatted for a few minutes. 
It was so nice to be able to help someone. 
She was so very pleasant and it brightened up my afternoon too. 
This app is the best thing since sliced bread!
- First Timer"
"Don‚Äôt get many call due to there are 1000% more people willing to help than there are blind, which is wonderful in my opinion. I wish there was even more I could do to help!"
I love answering calls to help the blind. It‚Äôs such an easy thing to do and I really love that I can help someone in need. From helping someone read a fortune cookie fortune to helping them set the oven timer. This app is amazing!
"I think this is a wonderful idea. Helping our community is a great way to show respect, love and appreciation. Everyone should help others. The world would be a happier place."
Easy to use and great way to help others in need. You get a call and can accept or decline. If you accept a video call starts and you answer a question.
"I received an email with information about this app and checked it out. Wow!!! Having a visually impaired father who resides in a different city, this is an amazing app to aid him with his daily life. Equally amazing... I can volunteer to help others with the same app."
I haveVolunteered to share my site and it is amazing I have not got my first car yet but I‚Äôve heard such great things about this app! I would recommend it!
Had my very first call today and was super excited! I helped a gentleman with cooking Instructions. I felt very useful especially this time of year! üòÑ
I love this app and being able to help those in need just makes the experience even better !
This is being a good human. I support and share this every chance I get. That is amazing works flawlessly never had issues
"Thru  this app, I am able to assist someone in immediate need and I absolutely can‚Äôt explain the thrill & joy that gives me when I answer a call."
I have had the chance to help 3 vision impaired ppl and it‚Äôs a wonderful feeling. I too have poor eyesight and I very well may have to use this resource someday.
It feels good to help out I get so excited when i see the notifications. I‚Äôve only assisted twice but I‚Äôm glad to have been able to assist
"I think this app is so cool, it‚Äôs easy to use as a volunteer and it warms my heart knowing I‚Äôm helping someone. I think it‚Äôs a great tool to give people another sense of security awhile being independent."
"I just got my second call to assist someone. While there aren‚Äôt many calls, it is nice to be able to help someone. üôÉ"
"It took a while, but I had my first volunteer interaction. This was definitely a great experience and look forward to helping in the future."
I‚Äôve had the app for a few months now and I‚Äôve received two calls and as soon as I answer it. It says someone else has answered the call :(
Amazing idea and app! Call came in perfect and I was able to help someone in a big way by doing something so small! Great job and thank you!
"I have had this app for about two-three weeks and i haven't gotten even a single notification from this app. I'm not sure if i'm just too late or there are just so many other people, but if you got this app to help people you're chances are very slim. 4/10 for the effort"
helping people out by just having them call me is so awesome! I've helped several people across america with tasks that will otherwise impair their whole day that i can help in just a moment!
"I received my first call a few moments ago!  
What an amazing feeling to be able to assist someone. 
As it turned out me and the caller have the same cable provider and remote."
"This app is awesome! I love being a volunteer and the fact that if I can‚Äôt answer a call, I don‚Äôt have to worry because there are so many volunteers it‚Äôs actually hard to get a call! Really great experience"
Just signed up yesterday was expecting a 3 month wait for my 1st call. Got 1 today from a Gentleman opening up a restaurant in California .  Needed help reading his shopping list. Very pleasant exchange & I hope to help more ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è.
"There are many more volunteers than blind users, but it‚Äôs really great that so many people want to help. It means that I don‚Äôt often get called upon to help, but it‚Äôs satisfying when I do."
Seriously love this app. I‚Äôve only helped two people in my short time as a volunteer but I really love being able to help someone in need! It‚Äôs easy and simple and I recommend it to everyone I meet!
I've helped several people via this app and always feel good about it afterwards. I don't get too many calls but always try to answer when I do.
I give this app 5 stars!! I can‚Äôt wait to answer my next call ! This app really makes me feel like I can help someone in need !
"I like the idea of this app. However, I am uncomfortable with their privacy policies. It seems like they want to collect a lot of personal information and they even say they will give your information to other organizations. I‚Äôm deleting the app. It‚Äôs a shame because I really did want to help."
"The several times I have been called, I have really enjoyed our interaction and I feel like I have been helpful. Thank you for letting me help!!"
"How amazing to be able to offer help to others in need through this app. What an ingenious, thoughtful, and simple approach."
Today I finally got to answer my first call and it felt so good! He just wanted to know how much he weighed. Stayed talking for a few minutes afterwards.
"It took a while to get my first call, but when I did I was SO excited. This app is incredible and it feels so good to help someone out."
"I am a low vision user of be my eyes. It is an amazing app! I have used it to make sure I shaved properly, double checked. Icriwave directions, and do much more! This app is a life changer!"
"Well iam truthlly surprise and iam welling to work whith companies which care about good for humanity iam greatfull for that gifts goven to me which is I knowing you.
Really appreciate all of you
Thanks with all my love, respects for all of you.
Saud Alkhaled"
I love being able to help out others by being able to volunteer to answer calls!
Whoever thought of this app is an absolute genius! I love the fact that i can help a visually impaired person whenever they need it right from home or wherever i am. This is amazing and extremely humbling!
Crowdsourcing a helping hand‚Äî just a brilliant concept. It‚Äôs so easy and takes minutes to be another person‚Äôs eyes as a volunteer. Very well organized and straightforward. TY Be My Eyes developers!
Whoever thought of this sort of assistance is a freakin‚Äô genius!  I was really happy to receive my first call for drink can identification!  I feel like I‚Äôve done something worth while by interacting with someone who needs it.
This app makes me feel great when I‚Äôve known that I was able to help someone. I helped someone measure out one cup of water for the microwave. I also helped read the direction to some medication. Very humble.
"This is such a great app, it really makes me feel good knowing how such a small thing for me to do is a big help to them."
"I‚Äôve taken two calls since joining and the app is user friendly, fast and just a great idea. Well done team"
Assisting the blind brings me so much joy. This app makes the world a better place. I hope it inspires kindness in others.
"Bro I‚Äôm so glad the creators of this made this app a thing, it‚Äôs so nice being able to know you can help someone out. Already signed up!"
"I'm so excited to take a call, and absolutely adore the lovely app you've put together to help others. Thanks!"
What a wonderful gift to give to people to make it so easy to do something so helpful for another human being.
"There really is no easier way to help others. The call comes to you, just answer the call and answer easy questions. Some that I‚Äôve had:
-‚ÄúCould you please tell me what the error message on the printer screen says?‚Äù

-‚ÄúCould you please tell me what color this tie is?‚Äù

-‚ÄúCan you please tell me what the label on this frozen food says?‚Äù

One of the more rewarding, and easiest, experiences of my life."
"I love being a help to a visual impaired person. I‚Äôm always super excited, and nervous. It‚Äôs alway great when I can accept a call. It‚Äôs also very cool that the volunteers outweigh those needing assistance."
The times that I‚Äôve provided assistance the connection was easy.  The folks needing aid were friendly and I loved the experience.
This app is a wonderful way to help others. I have done everything from read business cards to assembling children‚Äôs birthday gifts. I‚Äôve never had a bad call!
It takes 2 minutes of your time to be kind. High recommend this app. I received my first call the day after downloading the app.
"incredibly cool idea for an app, and executed really well. I answered my first call this morning and helped someone read some of his medication bottles. Simple and quick and its awesome knowing youre helping someone out!"
There are still no adequate words whereby I can carry over my thanks to the developper of the app... It helps us so much but even more as interesting for social compassion as I love it to the fullest.
I love that this app has taken our technology which we become glued to and provides a way to give back to others.
It‚Äôs such an easy way to assist someone else! I really enjoy being able to help someone more easily navigate around an unfamiliar space and contribute back to my community.
I downloaded the app and the first day I got a phone call and I was able to connect with a woman‚Ä¶ I was thrilled about it ...that was two months ago and I have yet to receive another phone call so it‚Äôs a little disappointing... I‚Äôm getting ready to delete the app because I‚Äôm not even able to help anyone
"Have answered about 3-4 calls, receive a call about once every 2-3 months. The App makes it easy to help others, so why not join?"
Every time I get a call I truly get excited. It‚Äôs awesome to be able to help someone no matter where you are located. The video quality it‚Äôs great and still gets better.
"I love this service and I‚Äôm so honored to he s seeing volunteer. 
The feeling you have after having answered a call is simply indescribable. Thank you for what you do."
Awesome idea! I wish they could spread the word farther so more blind people could use it. I still haven't been able to answer a call in time to help because there are so many sighted volunteers!
It felt really good to finally get my first call today and help and old blind man figure out which pre-made dinners he had bought. :)
Genius idea to help visually impaired through video chat. It makes my whole week better when I get a chance to help someone.
Got my first call today after almost a year of having the app. yes it was a long wait but i‚Äôm still very grateful to have gotten the opportunity to help.
"Thank love being a volunteer. It has been so cool to help those that I‚Äôve been lucky enough to answer a call. Really, sorry his is fantastic!"
It‚Äôs great to be able to help people out. It‚Äôs easy and simple and well worth the time. I look forward to each call!
"I love this app, when I‚Äôm at work or walking home from work I get these calls and it makes my day so much better! Just knowing that help is a phone call away mends my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è."
"I have received two video calls from the blind in 2018. Identified a pill, helped read someone‚Äôs thermostat and show which buttons to push to bring the heat on."
This is such a rewarding app! It‚Äôs so nice to be able to help! Today I received my first call! And nothing made me smile more than talking to the person I was helping! They were so greatfull and I felt so happy to help
"Haven‚Äôt gotten a call yet BUT the volunteers totally surpasses the blind, so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if I don‚Äôt get a call anytime soon. Will keep the app on my phone for 6 months. Or until I have no storage."
"I love the feeling of helping others!  This app helps me do that and I enjoy each time the notification rings on my phone üëçüèª As of yet, I cannot remember any issues with the app"
"What a great concept! Who wouldn‚Äôt want to be a volunteer, for anything‚Äîif you could do it from the comfort of your living room in a matter of 90 seconds.
My only complaint‚ÄîI wish I got MORE calls! üòç"
Just made me feel good to help a random person who needed it. They just wanted to know what their mail said. Makes ya think how much more useful this app is to some.
"I just took my first Be My Eyes call!  What a great experience! Someone wanted to know if they had used the right spices in their dinner. They did and it took all of 30 seconds to make their day!
#BeMyEyes"
"I can only find one negative thing to say about Be My Eyes,... I don‚Äôt get enough calls. Best Feel Good app ever. If you have a generous heart and helping others pleases you, this app is for you."
Just be aware that you could get sexual harassed on this app.  At the end of my first call after I helped this older man read a letter he panned the camera down to his penis.  I‚Äôm a dude and I felt pretty violated...I can only image how a young girl would feel who was just trying to help somebody.  Just a warning...I‚Äôm sure the app helps a lot of people but I cant be on it anymore.
I love helping others and this app puts me in touch with someone I can help.  I can‚Äôt describe how great it can feel and brighten your day to quickly help someone in need.  It is so easy and simple!
"I love this app. Everyone call that I answer is the most wonderful person needing a little help. I swear, I get more out of helping than the help I offer."
Would love to get calls far more frequently! Truly enjoy helping people in everyday tasks. Nice way to meet new people all over the world too! This world needs a lot more apps like this geared towards love and helping in many ways. üåéüíó
Always brightens up my day when I get a chance to help someone via this beautifully simple app.
Makes me feel so good to be helpful. Always try to answer as quickly as I can.
This app is so helpful for me. The volunteers are so helpful and friendly. I recommend every blind or visually impaired person get this app. It‚Äôs helped me in so many ways.
"I love love love this app. I don‚Äôt get calls often, but when I do, I‚Äôm thrilled to help! This is such a great idea! I truly hope it helps! And I‚Äôm glad to be part of it!"
I love helping people.   Be My Eyes APP is excellent for both the blind and the volunteers.  It‚Äôs excellent for the both because it‚Äôs gives him or her the opportunity to communicate with someone.
I‚Äôve gotten the opportunity to help three people with this app after only having it for 6 months. Absolutely love it.
"Thank you developers, creators, volunteers and everyone behind this fantastic app. 
What you‚Äôre doing for humanity is remarkable. Keep it up.
Can‚Äôt thank you enough."
I downloaded this app on a recommendation.   Our son is visually impaired and I am always looking for ways to help others as well. This kind of stuff is what smartphones should be used for!
"I think this is such an innovative idea, using the phone to do good things for other people.  I love it, pulled my car over to the side of the road just to answer a call!  Such a cool app."
"I am a ‚Äúhelper‚Äù, and so far I‚Äôve gotten two calls to help others! I just enjoy it, period! What a wonderful tool for the blind who need help with tasks that most of us take for granted!"
"This is a great app for a blind persons or anyone that needs another person to help them
 through the camera of their cell phones to see objects or guide them  I love this app thank you developer
Love this app"
"I think this is app is a wonderful idea, and the fact that thousands of people around the world band together to help visually impaired people with everyday tasks is absolutely amazing. 10/10"
This is an opportunity to give back. I found the app works seamlessly.  It was no different than FaceTime. I‚Äôm happy to be another resource for those that need help ‚Äúseeing.‚Äù
I recently helped a blind couple by telling them how much water went in one of their recipes. I love this app and everything it does to help the community! 5 stars no doubt.
"This is a wonderful program for those whose eye site is compromised. I enjoy helping. I don‚Äôt get to help as much as
I would like. It is nice when I get a call.  This program is great!"
"I‚Äôve never felt so useful while spending time on my phone. Really happy to be able to help people, but even happier that blind folks can reach out for help and know that they‚Äôre not a burden."
"What an amazing app and idea!! When I found it on the App Store and read about it, I felt overwhelmed to immediately jump in and volunteer! What a fantastic and invaluable tool for our visually impaired fellow human beings! Couldn‚Äôt be happier to assist!"
Feels great to be able to help others.  Highly recommended as either a person who needs help or a person offering to help others.
"Great app! There are so many volunteers, that I have never actually been able to help anyone. This is not a complaint, just an indication of how many great people out there, who want to help!"
Wonderful service!! Great way to help and connect with people!! Almost two years into using this app and still love it!!
I‚Äôve been in the app as a volunteer for one day and got my first call this morning. How very exciting it was to help someone!
"It is great app. I was blessed to received a call, and helped someone. To help someone you don‚Äôt need money, just donate a few minutes of your day. It is anonymous."
"I wish you could set your available time. Like after work, before work, etc."
"This app is so amazingüå∏it takes a while to get a call, but it‚Äôs worth it when you do ! So glad I could help someone üíï"
"I absolutely LOVE getting a call and helping someone....Whether its how many degrees the stove needs to be set at, helping with medication or anything!! Thank you to the creators of Be My Eyes!! So awesome!!"
What an incredible app to help those who need help seeing. Ingenious idea that I‚Äôve loved being a part of for a few years now!
I‚Äôve gotten to help twice so far. It‚Äôs a nice feeling to know that you could help someone when they need you.
People are each others‚Äô greatest resource. I hope this app grows and stays available to anyone who needs it.
I like the concept of this app but the only thing I‚Äôve received from be my eyes is a bunch of junk mail. I haven‚Äôt received any actual assistance requests. Maybe there‚Äôs too many people signed up to help that it hasn‚Äôt cycled to me but 3 months seems ample time for that to happen.
Is there a way to edit  between what hours you would like to accept calls?
"It only took 1 day until I received my first call . A man needed help reading his electronic blood pressure cuff. It only took two minutes out of my day, and was such a rewarding experience."
Honestly this is the best thing to do if you have a few minutes to spare and you don‚Äôt even get that many calls
Just got my first call. Helped a visually impaired lady by reading the label of her medication and then finding her desired tablecloth in a set of drawers. I even got to meet her service dog! Wonderful experience all around.
"There's absolutely nothing better than giving, and there no way more to give than with this app."
I love being able to help. I wish I was able to get more calls. I think it should be broken down by state.
I was so happy to get my first call after a few months! Glad that I could be a blessing to someone! I love this app!
I‚Äôve received 2 calls and each time they were disconnected‚Ä¶ errors occurred try again or contact support . That‚Äôs really unfortunate and I hope those reaching out for help were able to get in contact with someone else. Deleting app it‚Äôs a waste of their time and mine if I can‚Äôt assist when they need assistance.
This app is great and it really feels great knowing that in just a few moments you can really help someone. Just wish I got more calls.
"Please dl!
You are not bond to any hours
if you can‚Äôt answer the phone 
someone else will pick up!
i just took my first call today and i helped a lady identify spices in her kitchen! =)"
I am so excited to be able to help someone during my free time.
It is a blessing to be able to help others and this app provides the avenue to do just that.
Just had my first time experience being someone‚Äôs eyes. The feeling was so overwhelming and knowing I was able to help somebody was so gratifying!
"I just got my first call that I could answer, it feels so great to be able to help a visually impaired person with every day life"
"I would love to receive all the calls, any day , any time. There‚Äôs nothing more peaceful than helping someone. It would be an honour. Thank you for creating this app."
"As of now I have only answered one call, but there is no way to describe the feeling you get when you hang up the phone. I was so thankful to be able to help someone."
This app is perfect I every way. I have been able to help people without any trouble. Runs smoothly and I can always get a great connection!!!
The fact you can actually help someone and your not even there is mind blowing. I‚Äôve always wanted to help people and this is the best way possible.
For more than three years this app and allowed me to assist in making the world a more accessible and friendly place.
"I love using Be My Eyes. What a brilliant idea ‚Äì such a simple way to help people. The world would be better if more apps, like this one, allowed us to help one another and be our best selves."
"As a totally blind person, it is hard to describe how helpful this app has been to me. All of the volunteers are so nice. Thank you to the developers and all of the volunteers. Your time and effort are much appreciated!"
I love this app. It only take 5 minutes for most calls. I get 1-2 calls a month.
I can‚Äôt get over that it‚Äôs free for both parties. I helped a couple with a small child set up a Roku TV in their home. They were so thankful.
"...how many people with vision disabilities actually use this app?? I only was able to help 2 people in 2 years since downloading the app in 2018. I really want to help folks, but it seems like not enough people using the app."
"It was really easy, I hope to got more calls on the future."
I love being able to help others this way. I just wish the alert sound was louder.
I have helped two people so far and it has been great. I love being able to help someone when they need it.
It was so easy to use and so much fun doing for someone else. What a wonderful experience! Thank you for developing an app to be so useful for so many.
Download the app and simply wait for an opportunity to help someone else. Couldn‚Äôt be easier or have a better mission
I love assisting people through this app!! Helped the same lady twice in Arizona with putting batteries in her talking weight scale and helping go through mail. You meet some of the sweetest people!!!
"Super straight forward, and really rewarding. Be patient- there is a huge number of seeing volunteers compared to blind users. Got my first call after 6 weeks."
"I love the app so much! It‚Äôs brings joy helping others in a discreet way! 
I wish I could take AT LEAST one call a day, but LUCKILY there‚Äôs more volunteers than new friends needing assistance!"
I love this app! I was able to help a man read a notice from his apartment complex ! Everyone should get this. Help someone out and lend them your eyes for a few minutes. Help them be more independent!!
"When you need a pair of eyes, just call someone thru the app. My first call was from a woman who just wanted to know what colors her blouse was. It‚Äôs just such a easy way to be a blessing to someone."
While I‚Äôve only had 2-3 calls- they remind me to be more giving. The people have been most gracious it‚Äôs infectious!
It felt so good to be able to take 5 minutes out of my day to help someone else! This app has probably helped so many. What a wonderful idea
I‚Äôm visually impaired and this app is quick and easy to use   The volunteer was very nice and eager to help. I recommend the app to anyone who may need help with tasks because of low or no vision
This app is amazing. I have helped a couple people and it has been so cool. I love knowing there are so many volunteers that want to help others.  Thank you for making this app!!!
"Thanks for creating this app, I think it will help thousands of people and help others feel better by helping others"
This app is a wonderful way to be of service to others.
"Signed up as a volunteer and got my first call the very next day. Helped a nice lady find the right circuit breaker switch for her furnace. She seemed to have really appreciated the help. App worked flawlessly, what a great concept!"
I generally do not review apps but this is a concept that I can get behind. The app has improved substantially in past few months.
I‚Äôve been a volunteer now for 4 years. I highly recommend this app for those wanting to help others.
I am so grateful for the opportunity to help others by simply answering a phone call.
"I really love answering these calls, I truly love being able to help! I hope more people use this app who need help!!!"
Easy to use and I imagine so so helpful for those who need it. Lifting the world up one call at a time!
Feel no purpose? Help at least one person every now and then.
I feel like I really can help someone and make their day a little bit easier!
I love this app! I hope more people join so I can help more. I only have had one call since I got the app a couple years ago!
Very nice. Can receive assistance almost whenever I need it. Occasional he no volunteer answers. Sometimes have trouble with video quality. But very good experiences overall.
What a genius idea! I became a volunteer and have had my first call and I must say...it‚Äôs so heartwarming being able to assist others so easily!
Fairly easy to navigate but most importantly being able to help someone
"With so much volunteers on this app makes me so 
Sad that I have to wait to get my first call. I really 
Want to help out but I have patience l"
This is a very helpful app! More visually impaired folks must be made aware that it is out here just waiting for the opportunity to help them!!
Something so simple makes you feel like you made a small positive difference.
"No matter how quickly I answer the call, someone else has all ready answered it. Ive had the app about a year and tried to answer 7 calls, each time being told it was all ready answered so I have no idea if the app is any good or not."
This app exemplifies the good in the world. I wish there were more apps that made it this easy to  contribute to improving the lives of others.
This is one of the absolute best apps I‚Äôve ever used.  I can‚Äôt even tell you how amazing I think it is.  I love helping others and this app makes it so easy to do.  Wonderful idea!!
"Really enjoyed being able to help some 
One over phone with an easy to me task."
I was finally fast enough to answer my first call - interface is easy on the volunteer end.
For the few times I actually get a call it would be great if I could change the ringtone to something super obnoxious so I surely wouldn‚Äôt miss it!  Other than that this app is amazing!
This is my favorite app and I‚Äôm always waiting for a call to assist! Getting a call makes my entire day!!
This app feels as a great way to connect with people and help them out at the same time. Thank you so much!
I love this app but I have had it for a while now and still I haven‚Äôt ever gotten a call I am just wondering is it just me or is it someone else too? I haven‚Äôt received a single call at all. Can you please help me?
"What a great resource for visually impaired. I‚Äôve answered a couple calls so far, and it‚Äôs really fulfilling, being able to help someone out."
Been using this app for years to help blind people complete day to day a activities. Easy to use and rewarding. Give it a try.
"As a volunteer, I got to help a few times and whether it's helping with picking an outfit or identifying potato chip flavors I always leave the call happy and grateful I can help."
It‚Äôs great to be a help to people and this is one way that‚Äôs easy to fit into your busy schedule.
I‚Äôve been able to help two people. This makes me feel so good knowing it‚Äôs this easy to help someone else.
So far I have only received a few calls but I‚Äôm always happy to drop everything I‚Äôm doing to help out 100%. These guys are improving lives.
"I downloaded the app about 3 days ago. I‚Äôve gotten two called since then, both times I answered the app opened and was stuck on a loading screen. Now every time I open the app the only thing that works is settings and stories. The rest are just loading screen.  Makes no sense. I‚Äôve re-installed twice but still no fix."
The only problem I have is I wish you could set a time where you don‚Äôt get called since I sometimes get calls when I can‚Äôt get on my phone
Very simple and easy to use. I look forward to helping somebody in the future when they need help with some kind of task.
I definitely recommend this app to any blind or low vision user who needs help in any situation it‚Äôs very useful. Thank you to all the volunteers who helped us you guys rock
Joined this yesterday just thinking I‚Äôd be a volunteer just in case. Received a call today and helped someone sort through their mail. Amazing! Truly incredible!
I have had great experiences as both a sighted volunteer and having my parents receive assistance as low-vision callers. Highly recommended!
"I just had my first experience. I was kind of nervous, but I was so happy to help someone that need your help. It was very easy to work with this app to do something that is absolutely correct to do."
This is an amazing app that can greatly help blind people around the globe. I just wish there was a better advertisement for it so as more blind people could use it.
I was thrilled to get my first call to assist an individual. The feeling that I could be of use to someone else in need was indescribable. Great app!
This is one of my favorite apps because it is the easiest way to help someone using technology. Wholesome level 5/5
I got my first call today!! I signed up yesterday and the fulfillment it gave me is absolutely amazing! I can‚Äôt wait for the next call!
The last 3 calls I got have not worked
"This is a very good app with great intentions behind it, please update the video quality. It makes it hard to read labels and pick out items."
"I just had another amazing opportunity to help a visually impaired person virtually - through the ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù app.  

I helped him determine if a frozen rice pack he bought was microwaveable, how to unpackage it, and how to cook it. 

Started off my Sunday right!  Words cannot express how full and humbled my heart is this morning! üôåüèΩüñ§üôèüèΩ

 #BeMyEyes #Volunteer  #VisuallyImpaired"
"What a wonderful app - awesome way to help those who are visually impaired. I‚Äôve had 4 calls so far, and my experience has been great üòä"
Such a great idea. I am completely blind. This helps me so so much. Please continue updates
I love being able to help out. This app makes it so easy.
"I just answered my first call, just I can‚Äôt explain how great I feel from helping out the blind user. Thank you."
"Practical way to help someone with day to day tasks. Simple to use‚Äîanyone can do it. Conversations are task-focused, but it‚Äôs nice to have some friendly chatting, too."
I love the app I wish I had more chances to pick up calls they are few and far between
This helps so many with tasks you may think are simple but that others can‚Äôt do on their own.
I can not say enough about this app! I felt I made a difference in someone‚Äôs life even if it was just for a few short minutes!
Nothing makes me happier than seeing a notification pop up to help someone in need!  One kind act at a time will make love grow and prosper.
I am so glad that this app exists and that l get to be apart of it! Just received my first call today and l was ecstatic! It felt great knowing that l can be helpful to others. Can‚Äôt wait for another one...
I‚Äôve gotten one call in the almost one year I‚Äôve had this app on my phone. Super easy. I was able to help a delightful young man. No bother whatsoever.
This is the most exquisite example of humanity there is! To be a part of this group is a huge joy! I‚Äôve been a member is August 2017 and have received 5 calls! It‚Äôs been a joy.
Who would‚Äôve thought app and a call could help someone so much? So simple!!!! I love it!!! WOW!!!! So many volunteers!!!! I think everyone who is visually impaired should know about this app. What a wonderful thing! Brilliant!
"I answer about one call a month and I‚Äôm sorry it isn‚Äôt more often.

It‚Äôs easy to do and very nice be able to help people."
"What a fantastic idea! I got my first call about a day after I installed, a nice gentleman wanted to know what cereal was in the box on his counter. 
Warmed my heart to be able to help in even a small way."
Love this amp it was a pleasure helping out today I can‚Äôt wait for my next call.
As a volunteer I love knowing that I can help make a visually impaired person‚Äôs day a bit brighter and their life a bit easier üíú
I have answered several calls and it is very rewarding to be able to assist someone that needs a little assistance.
I love this app it lets me help people who need it and even though their are millions of other ways to help this is a good way to start
This is such a great way to help others virtually. Wether it is asking for clothing advice or how to work a new phone. A nice way to be helpful anywhere at anytime.
I always enjoy the interactions with people I am able to assist! I have no concerns and will keep this app active and open on my device for as long as I need to. :)
I‚Äôve recently downloaded the app and just a call today and I answered it and it said error and the. I was disconnected they should fix this problem I really felt bad but good because I was lucky to get a call to help someone in need .
"I have had this app for 7 months and got my first call yesterday. It was somebody asking to help name their medicine and organize it. It was very easy, not stressful at all. He was very nice."
"A wonderful mission, brilliant execution, and great quality. I‚Äôve never had a single problem with the app. I would recommend it to everyone!"
I love this concept. It brings to different people together. A complete stranger who needs help and the other person to help them. It‚Äôs beautiful.
"I haven‚Äôt gotten any calls after a week, but I guess that good? Nobody needs help ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This is a great app to have though, just to no you can help someone anywhere!"
I love being able to help people they are always so kind from many different areas. It‚Äôs so beautiful. Thank you for this app.
"Answered my first call yesterday, something that took moments of my time made someone else‚Äôs day easier.   What is better than that?!?"
"This app is probably doing a lot more for me than the unsighted person.  Every time I manage to help someone, it makes my whole day! üåà"
I had my first request this afternoon and it was simple and quick but it felt so good to be helpful to another. We need more of this!
"I witnessed my wife help someone set there new washer/dryer for regular loads and set markers for them to find it next time.
It was a miracle! And the problem was solved in minutes. So happy to help. Very gratifying!"
I got to help one person for the first time today. It felt so good. I have never felt so useful. Whoever came up with this idea deserves all the appreciation. Thank you for this app
Originally had this idea two years ago but I‚Äôm not a developer
I enjoy not only being able to help people but the ease with which the app makes it so.
"This is such a cool idea, with simple execution and easy to use - at least speaking for the sighted side of the process!

It's a small way to help others, and I'm so happy to found this app."
I get excited every time a call pops up. I love being able to meet people and help them out!
"Honestly one of the best apps I‚Äôve seen for the visually impaired!! As the parent of a blind teen, this app can n does help in soooo many ways with the challenges blind ppl encounter every day!!"
I am not blind or visually impaired but have successfully assisted a few people that needed assistance. It so useful and it‚Äôs a great feeling to connect with someone needing a little help!
I just got the app but just seeing how many people this helped is Incredible!!! It is a must have
It takes a while to get someone but it does work and you are helping!!
"I keep trying to sign up to become a volunteer, but my request always times out. Do you know how to fix this?"
"If you've used this app and missed calls because of the twinkly alert sound that is barely audible...raise your hand. üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
FIX. IT."
Have been able to assist a number of people with mundane task. A little good deed now and then makes us all better.
It‚Äôs so amazing how far we have come and now we can help those that need us this way at any time! Makes me so happy to be a volunteer to do this
Gives me a great sense of respect for the person I am speaking with. It makes me feel needed and I will gladly drop anything that I am doing to make sure I answer the call....
Can‚Äôt believe how something so simple can be such a life changer for so many people.  I only regret that I didn‚Äôt find out about this earlier.
Thank you for this wonderful opportunity to assist! I enjoy having the chance to interact with persons who are visually impaired. It is a learning experience for me every time.
After a month got my first call and was able to help a blind user sort some paints. Very cool and I was glad I was able to help a stranger.
"Amazing app!
Helping people in this way is absolutely brilliant idea add the feature for the multi languages speakers to add more than one language will be much more helpful and faster!"
"I only get a call maybe once a month, but I love getting a chance to help someone, even if it‚Äôs in a small way. This app is a wonderful thing!!"
I alway felt the need to help the blind people and i always trued to imagine how hard it is for them... This app atleast gives me a chance to assist them in their life.
"I love making anyone‚Äôs day brighter. If taking a 2 minute call or 2 hour call(if I can) makes a persons day that much easier, then here I am!"
"Love this app, I wish I could do more but it makes me feel good to know that I was able to contribute and help someone to remain independent."
Just got my first call and it felt so good to help a girl turn her heat up since she wasn‚Äôt sure if it was all the way up - I imagine it‚Äôs hugely helpful for the blind - love it!
Love this app and the people behind it
I finally got to answer a call & help today!The call was quick & easy & made me happy to help.
"This app is so so easy to use, and so helpful for so many people out there!! I can‚Äôt wait to answer again!"
I really appreciate giving back to people who have lost or never had eyesight
Just had my first call. Lasted about 30 seconds. I cannot wait to do more.
I love serving people.  It‚Äôs so easy to make a big difference with a small effort.  I feel blessed each time I get a call.
Great app! I just wish I knew how many lives I‚Äôve impacted through the app. Like a spot that says calls answered : blank
This app is a great way to help the Blind and Low Vision community! It‚Äôs so simple to use and really allows you to make a difference in someone‚Äôs day to day life!
"I finally got my first call after downloading the app this past summer, I was so excited! And the lady I helped was very grateful!"
"I wish I got more calls, only have been able to help once."
But I couldn‚Äôt help but crack up at the demonstrated photos provided like how am I supposed to describe what the color of the shirt is to someone who can‚Äôt see!? üòÇ
I‚Äôve had the opportunity to answer a few calls  and was successful. I wish I had more!
"I saw something about this app on another site and immediately downloaded it, excited to help and use it. Wish I could give it 0 stars because I registered and can‚Äôt view any content now about the app. Won‚Äôt even load the main screen after registering and force closing and reopening many times. Unusable app."
"I‚Äôm not technically savvy 
Yet this App is so simple and user friendly 
To be of service aiding others with Big & little daily tasks, is a Gift to all involved.

‚ÄúSometimes the greatest contribution we can make is to allow others to contribute to us‚Äù  
I weep with joy when I read the stories 
This is the kind of world ( Community) I hope to age into. 
Cooperation vs competition"
"I was able to help a women choose clothes for an interview. It was a fantastic way to start the day, my daughters watched in awe and talked about it all day!"
An app that really lets you help others. This is one step you can take to make this world a better place.
I just want to say that every time I answer a phone call it makes me feel awesome I can help someone! I will forever be a ‚Äú Be My Eyes‚Äù participant!
My only critique of this app is that I don‚Äôt get more calls! ‚ù§Ô∏è Got my first call today and had such a great time talking with a gentleman in California who needed some help. Great app!
The app works well and is easy to use/navigate.. but the cause is easily the best part of this. Great idea! Takes so little time to significantly help someone out!
My favorite app because it lets me be helpful to others. A great and super simple way to help with those things we take for granted daily.
"The app is super easy to use, I had been eagerly awaiting my first call I have to say I had a wonderful experience. Highly recommend signing up!!"
The app is very easy to use for those providing assistance to the blind. I love being able to help someone with the tasks that I might take for granted every day!!
this app is so great. you can help people who need help with everyday tasks that are a bit hard for them. But the feeling of helping them is great. i love it
Such a great idea. I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to help someone within the first month of signing up. It was very quick and easy.
"I love it! This is such an easy, simple way to make small positive differences in the world. Downloaded this yesterday and just answered my 1st call. It was quick and successful. Please download!"
"I absolutely love this app! So happy to help and be of service to others! This is Gold! Please don‚Äôt hesitate, it‚Äôs truly rewarding for both parties. God bless you all!"
Great app! I‚Äôve answered several different calls and I love being able to connect with and help strangers!
This app leaves me speechless. It‚Äôs truly amazing. I just helped a women set the temperature of her stove. And now I‚Äôm crying! I wish I could help people every single day.
"I wish I got more calls. 
I love it when I can help someone.
I‚Äôm glad an application like this exists."
This app is such an amazing creation and it just makes me feel so good to be able to help when I get a call! I love it !!!!
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help those in need! Awesome app!
"I can‚Äôt even begin to state how well this app is designed! The idea is amazing, it feels so good to have this app on my phone."
I‚Äôve only got one cal sense I‚Äôve downloaded this but it felt so great to help someone üòçüòçüòçüòçüòá
This app is awesome! I‚Äôve only answered one call since there are so many users and less applicants but it was so worth it !!! Tell all visually impaired friends about this app! It‚Äôs legit !!!
"Honestly, can you have anything negative to say about something so beautiful and thoughtful for our world!? I‚Äôll never delete this app ever!!"
I love this app and every time I get to answer a call it puts a smile on my face. I tell everyone that day that I got to answer a call and help someone in need.
I was surprised to get my first call today and I felt so good helping someone out!! Took a few months before I got one call but that was awsome! üòÅ
Being of service to another human being is giving the best of Yourself. This app is 100% worth it.
"Even though I have not yet answered a call the app is so intuitive and for such a good cause üëè to the people who have made this
(I am not a Russian bot cuz a Russian bot wouldn‚Äôt admit to not being a Russian bot)"
What a quick and easy way to help someone!! Just explain what you see and the results are amazing!!
"Be My Eyes is an amazing app that allows you to provide assistance to people that need help around the world due to impaired vision or blindness I love helping people with technology so this is right up my alley.

Kind regards,

Kevin"
Are you kidding me to be able to do such a good thing for people in need this shows me there are still good people in this world I‚Äôm proud of you good guys!
App is easy to use.  It‚Äôs a gift to be able to help someone.  It takes so little commitment from me.  Can‚Äôt wait for my next call.
I would like to help more often. I may only get a hit once every couple months.
"This app is great! I was able to help a lady install software in her laptop which normally talks to her but this time it wasn‚Äôt talking to her, so I instructed her thru the installation process."
Love being able to help people in need especially when it‚Äôs this convenient.
It‚Äôs a great application thank you for everyone making this application Working  thank you especially for all volunteers in this network
What a wonderful tool. I can‚Äôt tell you how excited and good it felt to aid someone in need. Even if it was only for simple cooking instructions.  üòéüòä
"I got a call once and was able to help someone with their dinner Ingredients. I loved being able to help, and am so happy that someone created this app!"
"The app is easy to use, intuitive, and not even slightly glitchy!  My video chat with a visually impaired person was seamless and simple.  Well done!"
The app is so easy to use and explains how to use it if you aren‚Äôt tech savvy. It‚Äôs also a very kind idea and is helping thousands of blind people around the world.
If I had to delete every app but one on my phone....I would keep Be My Eyes.  I'm grateful for the developer and for every person I've come along side thru this app!
"Be My Eyes is so amazing. This app is so helpful to those that are blind and or visually impaired, and helping people like that just makes my day. The app is set up very simply and is easy to navigate! I love it!!"
"Such a powerful, novel use of smartphones. I don't get called often (ratio of volunteers to users is about 10:1), but always enjoy when I do."
This is such a wonderful app idea. The founder should be so proud; I can‚Äôt imagine all the help this brings to the blind community. I cannot wait to get my first call! üôèüèºüòáüëºüèº
Just got my first call and it was the most amazing thing my caller wanted help looking for meals and I‚Äôm so glad I could help her
This is such a terrific and easy way to assist someone from anywhere at anytime by simply being their eyes.
"I had my first call and was blown away. A gentleman needed help identifying business cards he had in his wallet. Simple task, but it was so nice to help him. What a great app!"
Such a great app to help people in need. It‚Äôs super simple to use and you get to meet amazing people along the way!
I am so glad that we get to help the blind and help them do everyday things we would do!
So excited about this app. So amazing that you guys created this app. Can‚Äôt wait to help people around the world!
Someone is playing pranks with this app. I‚Äôve actually helped people before but someone is using it that doesn‚Äôt.
Putting the power of a smart phone to practical use is genius!
"Be my eyes is an overall great concept it lets people from all over the world help the visually impaired, the only flaw and I am not sure if this is a bug is that I‚Äôm not getting any notifications about calls"
Sometimes there is just a visual notification an no sound
"I use this service almost daily. I lost my vision Thanksgiving Day 2016 from a Traumatic Brain Injury due to an IED blast. I‚Äôm totally blind so I get things mixed up like Alpo Dog food and Chili. Brown shirts and Black pants. 
SGM Brian Davis
US Army (Ret)"
I had my very first call today from someone in need and I was a little nervous at first. But it was a great experience. Thankful I found this app!!
Such a wonderful concept and easy way to give and help others. Brilliant
"It really works! I am blind and I have used this  App to find out if my shirt is clean what my air-conditioning says, and,  even how to set my stereo! Thank you! Thank you One and all"
"I‚Äôve had this program since early 2016 & i‚Äôve had the opportunity to help five people so far.
This is great for people who love to help people in immediate need. 
Happy to help!"
"I was using this app to try and find my shoe. I tried connecting with someone who was no help, especially when a young woman ran up to me and stole my shoe!! She took it and RAN so I had to follow her using solely my ears. I tripped because this person didn‚Äôt warn me of a bush!! I was so hurt I started to cry. Then they must have reported me because I was banned! 1 out of 5 stars."
I have had this app for about 3 months and just answered my first call!  I helped someone read the ingredients on the back of a pasta box.  I LOVE the concept of this app. I‚Äôm happy to help :)
This is a really useful app for people who are visually impaired . There just needs to be a way to track its use . I wish  it would somehow annotate how many times i've helped out people .
I downloaded this app to help blind people but I don‚Äôt want to call them
"I was so glad I got a call the other morning tht woke me up . I was in a bit ofDepression, lifted me and I‚Äôm so glad I could help ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I love to receive calls to help with the Be my Eyes App.  I am available for more calls than I receive.
"I love having the opportunity of helping people, thank you so much to the creators of this application and services."
Absolutely love this app and that I can help others see.
"Please download this app, because u can help a lot of blind people ü•∫ many thanks to whom invented this app"
I love this app and being able to help people. I just wish I‚Äôd get more calls to help more people :)
I have never been so impressed with an app before. This was a genius idea and I love that we have the technology to help the visually impaired. Love love love.
I love the great idea of this app! Every time I have a call make my day! I love this app gives me the opportunity to help others. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I was really excited when I found this app, I really wanted to volunteer. When I try sign up (not matter which way) it‚Äôs says ‚Äúerror timed out‚Äù 
For the last 2 hours..... probably will have to delete 
It‚Äôs a great concept but if you can‚Äôt even sign up it‚Äôs kinda a waste of an app no?"
"Great way to help others, especially when you have a lot of free time on your hands"
I am thrilled at how well the call went. It felt AMAZING being able to help someone who lives there life without sight. What a wonderful app! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"This is so helpful to many people all over this world. This is amazing, a great way to work together and help everyone any way we can."
Most amazing app EVER!!! The help it‚Äôs already given my blind dad in just three days has been wonderfully astonishing!
"Not only does this app help humans who are blind or have low vision, it helps bring joy to humans who get something out of helping others. It‚Äôs a win-win. Technology at its very best."
Haven‚Äôt received a single call. It‚Äôs been almost a month. They allow anyone to be a volunteer but there are not enough users on the app who require its services. So you waste space with an app and eventually forget you even have it. Was looking forward to helping others. Now it‚Äôs just cluttering my phone.
One of the best apps and even greater initiative. Easy to answer calls and help the needy. I‚Äôve got three calls so far. Thanks for developing this app.
This is a great app. A couple min of my time for the wonderful feeling of knowing I‚Äôve been able to help someone.
Just got my first phone call in less than a week from downloading it. This is the neatest thing to be a part of!
"I love to help others and in anyway at all, it just makes me feel good to do thing I was put here for. I think this is the best app ever to come out."
What a fabulous idea.  To make some basic assistance available like this is amazing.  I love being able to do something so simple to be helpful!
Easy to answer and help. Makes me smile to be able to be of service! Fantastic app.
It‚Äôs very easy to navigate the app & great opportunity for service work. Answering calls is very easy.
Awesome app for visually impaired individuals who need help with things we take for granted. I‚Äôve answered a half dozen calls and it is simply GREAT.
I love being able to help people and really enjoy this. Thank you.
"I am very blessed, more so then I deserve so this app is a great way to give back and share my blessings!"
Feels good to be able to help others.
A wonderful service and I am happy to be a part of it!
I wish I got these calls everyday! Soo amazing and love being able to help
It‚Äôs very kind to help people but a lot of people are here so it‚Äôs hard to get a call but kind
I answered my first call today and it was so fun to help out somebody in need. The video feed was fantastic too.
"I really enjoy how it feels when I hear the sound of my Be My Eyes App, and I know, that the opportunity to helping someone in need, is just on the other side =)!"
I love helping everyone whose calls I‚Äôm able to answer. It really helps those who are vision impaired‚ù§Ô∏è
This app is easy to use and it is an amazing way to use technology for good!! I‚Äôm grateful that I get to help people and stay safely at home!!!
I‚Äôve been a sighted user for some time and every experience using this app has been incredibly rewarding for me and for the caller.
I have missed several calls bc the app does not respond when I swipe or press to answer. It is very frustrating! I want to help and I am unable to. I have looked over the directions multiple times and I have done everything asked. Please do something to fix this!
I‚Äôve had this downloaded for days.... nothing ... like an I useful app sitting.... I‚Äôm deleting right after I post... wanted to be useful and help people... but the app is not at all not even in the least what I thought it was. I haven‚Äôt gotten even one notification to help anyone... and there‚Äôs nothing else you can even do with this pointless app.
I absolutely LOVE this app. So glad to be able to help folks and lend them my vision for whatever they need. THIS is what technology should be used for <3
This is such an amazing app. Why not give a few minutes to help someone when you can? Do it.
Applause to the developers!  I love be my eyes and am so glad to be able to connect with and help others from around the world.
This program is fabulous and I'm so happy to be able to help others this way.
"I have only gotten to assist one person with this app so far, but it felt so rewarding. This is such a great use of technology, and I‚Äôm proud to be able to help ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Great idea. I‚Äôm glad somebody has thought of it. Is good to know it‚Äôs helping thousands of people. If you downloaded this app expecting a ton of calls to help. Don‚Äôt!!!! I have had app downloaded for three weeks, and zero calls have come in."
This app is so helpful to the blind community and it also gives the sighted community a way to easily engage and help the blind community. It is so satisfying and rewarding to use as a helper.
I love to help people. I fully believe that it is our duty and obligation to help those who can‚Äôt help themselves. This app helps me and so many other people to help people. I love it!
This is such a great service that this app provides. I have gotten many calls and it‚Äôs always nice to be able to help out.
I feel like I‚Äôve won the lottery whenever I get the opportunity to help someone! This is an incredible app and a wonderful resource for the blind community.
I love helping people navigate daily tasks that we take for granted. Thanks for this app and idea!!
"This is a fantastic app with a wonderful purpose. It feels really good to help others. 

Developers: Please allow users to set our own alert tone! The current built-in tone is very hard to hear."
"I answer calls and help people get things done, no hassles on my end!"
It feels good to know that I can help someone in even a small way.
I get a Be My Eyes call about once a week and it just makes my day.
Just something so small can make some ones day
This app is a wonderful way to be a friend to anyone! PLUS I have shared this app with others who are visually impaired yet had no idea this app existed!
Getting a call and being able to help is a indescribable feeling!!
This is a great app and without question one of the best possible uses of technology. One of the brightest stars of humanity.
"A great app to help those who need help. I‚Äôve helped 3 and all three callers were the sweetest people ever, never take your eyes for Granted‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
Makes this a better world
I am so happy to be so easily connected to offer help when I can!!
Being able to help others is so wonderful and it‚Äôs so easy. I‚Äôm always humbled by a call and I‚Äôm glad to be apart of such a great app.
I love to help others with this app. You can forget how something that is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù can be a challenge to someone else.
So simple to use as a volunteer. Can easily decline a call if you can‚Äôt take one for some reason (it rolls to another volunteer).  A nice way to be helpful in the world üòä
I love this app ! I. Am excited to help and if a call comes in at a time I can‚Äôt take it I‚Äôm happy it goes to the next volunteer! Great concept and a joy to be part of!
I‚Äôve helped several people and it‚Äôs so smart and super easy to do!! Thanks so much for this opportunity to help others!
I want to make an impact on the world in any way I can and be my eyes can help me to make a difference in many ways
Still waiting for the call
I love the idea of this app and the fact that it helps but it takes so long to load I have t been able to answer a call. I‚Äôve had three so far and everyone one took so Long to load.
"I just answered my first call. It was to help someone see a tracking number on a shipping receipt. Such a simple thing! I was so happy to help! She was in India I think, I‚Äôm in illinois. So cool!"
Nice concept. Received my first call felt a little fishy. Guy was in a room (looked like a bedroom) and was asking for help finding the door. Got up out of bed and fell dramatically. Ended up helping him locate door and handle. Hope he really needed help but felt more like a prank.
I heard my phone ring and ran from the other side of the room to answer it but by the time I got to the phone I was too late. Wish I had more time to answer.
"I love getting calls on here, I appreciate being able to help another person"
"This app is exactly what it‚Äôs description shows.
Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that a couple of calls had video issues.

In all, however, I love the idea of the app.
I get a rush of adrenaline when I see my phone ringing and the BeMyEyes logo on the screen.
Can‚Äôt answer it fast enough!
Each call is a moving experience, despite the simplicity of the request coming from the other end."
Easy to use. Voice and video quality are great. Very helpful to people who can't see and need help seeing.
"I love being able to help someone. And, being their eyes for just a moment blesses me. I pray it also blesses them."
"In under a minute, I made a difference.  A stranger needed help, and I was there. Such a rewarding app!"
I helped a man pick out an outfit! We chose the black pants with a blue and gold tie! It was my very first time assisting someone from the app! I also got pinned today as a DA! How cool!! ü§©ü•∞
This app is so easy to use and each call I receive has been a great experience. Love it.
"I‚Äôve not even signed on yet. But the conception of such an app humbles me. If legitimate this app has restored my faith in humanity. 
                    We walk by faith not by sight
Thumbs up."
I had to call someone to make this message thanks so much
I love that this is available and wish it were available for more disabilities.
Being a volunteer makes me feel so happy to be able to help people
"Although I don‚Äôt get calls often, I love that I can help people who need help"
"I love having the ability to help someone, who really needs my help!"
Be My Eyes is such an easy and effective way to help someone with a task that can make life so much easier to the blind person.
I love getting calls! Racing to be the first to answer! I love being able to help make someones life a bit easier!
This app makes me feel like I really make a difference I actually get mad when I don‚Äôt get calls lol I love helping. By far my favorite app
It‚Äôs easy to use and just a simple push notification. Good quality video. Sound is on point. Love this idea.
I just got it yesterday and just received my first call this morning. What a great app that encourages people to have compassion for one another!!
I always feel so good after being  able to help someone through this app!
"This app is absolutely incredible, what an easy way to help a stranger and make a little bit of difference in their day"
Can't say enough good things about this app. Happy to see over half a million active users
I really love this app because it allows me to help and meet some incredible people around the world!
Best app !
"This is the most fulfilling experience I have ever done, I am honored to be a part of the ‚Äúbe my eyes family‚Äù !!"
I love the fact this app helps me connect to people who need my help and I can be an assistance to them.
It‚Äôs so easy to use and I enjoy the fact that it helps so many people.
"THANK YOU FOR THIS APP....it‚Äôs amazing to be able to be able to help someone, that‚Äôs all I want in life is to help other people. God bless whoever created this app üíñ"
What a great way to help someone with something we take for granted. Thank you for allowing people to help others. I love the app!
The call that I had was such a lovely experience and I love that this service is available for those who need it!!! Love love love
"This app is very simple to use, and the people on the other side of it are so grateful for the help. Give it a try!"
Great way to meet some wonderful people!
"Together we can change the world, no matter where we are in the Universe. Two Eyes  One World."
Haven‚Äôt used the app yet but I‚Äôm excited to help out the blind any way I can
Loved being able to help
Great idea! Downloaded thinking I could help someone. Every call I get helps me more.
This brightens my day more than any other app. Happy to help anytime I‚Äôm called
"I am so grateful to you for giving me this chance to help someone.
That is such a good feeling that I can‚Äôt describe it‚ù§Ô∏è."
"The idea that anytime, anyone anywhere, could help someone in a substantial way with the smallest of efforts is an amazing thing."
Highly recommend if you want to help out someone. It's an easy way to use one's full visual capabilities to good use.
I don‚Äôt get a lot of calls but when I do it‚Äôs all t of fun and makes me feel great! My kids enjoy helping as well!
I have pure joy assisting persons with Low vision or Blind!!! A personal reminder that I can help in many ways!!!  Give it a try and be bless by your contribution!!!
I feel so good being able to help someone who needs me. Thank you for a brilliant app!!
"Absolutely incredible, I am a volunteer and I can‚Äôt help but feel a full heart knowing I made a small difference in someone‚Äôs life today ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I absolutely love this app! It is great to have assistance anytime you want to. Thank you volunteers for taking your time out to help the blind community.
I received my first call today and it made my day so much. Thank you for inventing this app and allowing me to help others!
"Simple, well built app with a great concept. I hope they allow customized availability on future versions."
"Really, such an easy way to make someone‚Äôs day a little less complicated.  Do this- if will make your day."
"I saw this app in my suggested and it just made my heart swell to know that people are working together to help those in need, no matter how small."
Just had my first call with Phyllis from North Carolina :) what a gratifying way to start my day. Thank you for making this possible.
It just takes a moment and you can make someone‚Äôs day a little easier.
Really clean and easy to use interface that supports those who would otherwise go underserved.
Glad someone thought of this to help those that are visually impaired. Works and functions well.
I downloaded this app to help others. And now I am downloading it for my mother! It helps a lot. Great ideas and God bless the creators.
This is definitely an application I would recommend. Feels good to help
"If you love helping others and care about people... this is the app for you!

It doesn‚Äôt ring often ‚Äî which is a bummer. 
However, when it does, it is one of the most memorable experiences you‚Äôll have. 

I got to read a short story to a child of a blind mother back in 2018. Ill never forget that."
I love it. I loving getting calls and helping.. wish i could get more calls..
It‚Äôs nice that there are substantially more volunteers than blind users. And calls are answered very quickly.
"What an amazing experience to help others!!! This app is life changing for so many people, I‚Äôm so grateful that I  came a cross of it!"
How does a blind person use there phone
"I just got my first call. Independent Cheyenne in Colorado, you‚Äôre amazing and I hope you go on to do all of the things we talked about!"
"I get that it has a good intention behind it but how tf a blind person supposed to download, sign up and use the app when the whole point of it is for when they don‚Äôt have anyone else around to help them"
"I‚Äôve had it for 4 months and have never needed to help anyone bc there‚Äôs like 3 million not blind people and like 150,000 blind people"
thank you for this humbling moment... all he wanted was to set his oven to 425. you would have thought i bought him a new oven... #WhenTechnologyWins
"It is rare that technology fulfills it‚Äôs promise to lessen burdens, but ‚ÄúBe My Eyes‚Äù does that for both the blind and the sighted. Sighted volunteers conveniently assist the blind, both with the ease of pushing a button on the phone."
Such a pleasure to be able to do a kindness for another. Just takes a second.
I joined Be My Eyes back in June of 2018 and it has been Amazing. I have helped about 10 people now and Everyone is different. This app is truly a blessing for both parties.
This is the greatest app for helping those in need.  It is simple and easy to use and make a profound change in someone‚Äôs life.
This app is brilliant!  I got my first call a few days ago. It took less than a minute to respond and I felt great all day !
I‚Äôve answered a few calls and each time has been great. I love being able to help people. Such an inspiring app üòÅüòÅ
Used the app for the first time and it was easy to  manage and functioned well.
Enjoy being able to help someone in need. Keeps me very thankful and grateful. Glad y‚Äôall came up with an App to help people out.
I just answered my first call. The app worked beautifully and was quick and easy to help someone out. Absolutely love it!
Being able to help someone out even just a little is a great feeling! Whoever created this app is genius!
I love that I can help someone across the world with something and just be able to help them get through their day! :)
This is one of the best things I have ever come across. I cannot wait to use it and think it is absolutely brilliant!
This is what the internet is for--making helping each other easier. I'm a sighted volunteer and I love being part of Be My Eyes.
I love what this app is doing. Such a great resource for those in need. Feels great to be able to help someone out :)
I am so happy that I got to help someone. I can‚Äôt wait to do it again and again!
I registered 3 days ago & while on a Job conference call I literally hanged up & answered my first call! Super excited and Grateful ‚ù§Ô∏è & Humble
Great that one can help others without going anywhere!
This is a must have! We have to help one another and this app allows us to do just that! This is an awesome app that everyone should have!
I suggest a way to take picture instead so that when we look at documents or anything it‚Äôs not blurry through a call.
It would be helpful to allow volunteers to enter their availability to receive calls.
Feels great knowing my phone usage can be used productively in terms of this app. Highly recommend all individuals to download!!
Such a brilliant idea- I love being able to help others so easily and quickly.
"A wonderful idea to bridge the gulf between the seeing eye and non-seeing eye, and a tool of compassion that harnesses technology to link cultures.  I am so privileged to be a part of this experience.  ‚Äîhilary"
I absolutely love the bridge this app creates! Getting to share my sense of vision is what I likely take for granted often. This app keeps me grounded and blessed to help others
I just hope that I can help as many people as I possibly can.
I‚Äôm the daughter of a blind mother.  I understand what it meant to my mom to have independence.  Im happy technology is such that I can help in a small way for someone to have that.
Still haven‚Äôt received a call but I‚Äôm looking forward for it :)
So glad to be able to help out!
I was connected for my first call. Wow.. the feeling and smiles I have now are out of the roof. I was able to help him with hard wiring instillation. Wow.. love this.
"One thing I love about this app is that there is no money involved, just people helping people who need it."
Always love taking a call to help someone in need
It is a great feeling being able to help a stranger! Only bad part is I wish I received more calls they are so rare!
So glad I found this app... a beautiful small way to help someone in need
First call was a success! Thankful for being able to help!
"Ive just helped someone find the ice water button on their fridge, such a great idea. Highly recommend"
This is such an amazing app! A couple of mins of your time can really go a long way in someone‚Äôs life
"It‚Äôs an amazing concept, using technology to help others. It brings perspective into your life about what we take for granted."
I received a call from a lovely young lady that needed help sorting items for a local school‚Äôs concession stand. It was her way of contributing.
My first call to help someone I was so nervous and excited to help. It‚Äôs the 4th of July and even though I‚Äôm with family I was happy to help. This app is great.
This is an amazing concept and with over 2 million volunteers someone has access to help instantly. Great job everyone!
Such an amazing experience! I love this! I am humbled and gain way more from these simple acts than I give in ‚Äòhelping‚Äô. I highly recommend!!!
Easy to use and helps others. This should come installed on every phone.
Being able to help while out and about is an amazing feature!!!
"There‚Äôs nearly a million volunteers helping people. Don‚Äôt anticipate a call right away. 

When you do assist, talk to them. Let the person know what you see. Is the camera out of focus? Is the item out of view? Be their eyes and tell them what you see. 

Be patient, kind, and enjoy the experience of helping someone. 

This is a great app!"
"On several occasions I‚Äôve had the opportunity to ‚Äúloan‚Äù my sight another person, I‚Äôm always glad to help."
"This app is really amazing and a big bow to the developers, in this busy life atleast we can help the people who are in need through this app"
I  just answered my first call and it was a great experience. Cant wait for the next.
I which I would get more calls. It feels great helping.
I love this concept! I have been a volunteer for almost a year now. So glad I could help ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love this app but my job makes it literally illegal for me to answer the calls while working.
This is very helpful app for the blind I‚Äôm a volunteer I haven‚Äôt helped anyone yet but I can already tell I‚Äôm going to love volunteering for the blind.
Helped with my second call tonight. It didn't seem genuine. If it wasn't I won't give the person satisfaction of listing the details. Just know that I was cursed at for trying to help. This experience makes me question if the first call was real.
Very rewarding and convenient to be a volunteer by simply doing what you already do every day (have phone in hand)
I think this app is proof that mankind can come together as one. The struggles and challenges that blind people face on a daily basis is astronomical. This is one way all of us can help out. Great App.
I just took my first call! It was such a simple thing but I felt like I had really made a difference for someone. üòä
Signed up as a volunteer yesterday... received my first call today! Helped an individual preheat an oven for preparation of chicken breasts.   Extremely rewarding!
My first call was to help a father put his PlayStation on the right game for his child!!! Granted I had to get my son to help him because I do not know PlayStation!!
I saw this on a singer‚Äôs ig story glad I m helping people thought not have a good command of english but Iam trying my best to learn! And I think more app like this should be developed
Installed and cannot wait to help people from the comfort of my home and phone.
Kudos for those who developed this app. I am happy that my tiny help can be very meaningful to someone through this app.
I love being able to help people and the app is always so easy to use!!!
Love that their is something out here to amke the world just a little better
This app is apparently helpful for visually impaired people but it is so helpful to me and my soul!  I love it! All the feel goods after a call
It‚Äôs such a great concept to help those all around the world!
This is such a great app. I‚Äôm so happy to volunteer and be able to make someone‚Äôs life a little bit easier for them!
"This app is incredible I‚Äôve only got one call in about a month but I love it, the idea behind this is amazing I‚Äôm honored to be apart of this movement!"
The best app! It‚Äôs a blessing to have eyes and to help those who aren‚Äôt able to see well or to see at all. My first call humbled me.
"This is a nice app that helps blind users and the visually impaired, it makes me happy knowing I can help someone out over a simple phone call"
"I got my first call for help and I was just so happy to help someone!  I was a little nervous, but now, I am ready for more calls.   Great idea-great app!"
Super easy to use. It‚Äôs a joy to be able to help someone. I love the idea behind this app and am so excited to keep helping.
"Got my first call after 3 months....and someone else answered it before I could! Good to know the blind are taken care of, I just wish I could do more."
App works well. I‚Äôm happy that I am able to help others through this app.
I rush to be the first to answer. Really enjoy being able to connect and help!!
I look forward to Seeing  will be my eyes technology takes us into the future.
This is an amazing app! I‚Äôm so happy to be able to assist blind individuals who need a little help!
I live in St. Augustine Florida where one of the top Deaf & Blind Schools is located. This has been an invaluable resource for our location.
So thankful to be able to help others and release the stress of tasks for others.
Had my first call today! Amazing! Feels so good to assist people in need of things we take for granted!
This makes it easy to help people! Sometimes the littlest things mean so much.
"No complaints, lets you help in a small way sometimes. Great idea for an app."
"I had high hopes when I learned of the app. Still think it‚Äôs an awesome concept but after signing up in July, I‚Äôve yet to receive a call. I‚Äôd love to help, and would love to receive a call & update the rating but I guess until I do I have to leave at 1 bc I‚Äôm still not sure it really works."
One of the coolest apps I have on my phone. I love helping people and it‚Äôs so comforting knowing there‚Äôs a free resource for people in need!
Highly recommend people to download this app!
Love helping these people it‚Äôs easy and makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face all day
Whoever created this app deserves great things in life. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to help another human.
This makes my heart smile. We need more technology focused on doing good like this one
What a joy to be a part of this community
Call quality has excellent video and audio. Feels great to help someone!
How could anyone rate such a great app less than 5 stars.
This is such a beautiful thing to be able to help others through an app on your phone‚ù§Ô∏è love small acts of kindness
I don‚Äôt know who made this app but there needs to be more things like this in the world! We need to help eachother more and not hurt eachother!
"When I open the app all I see is a spinning icon (like it is trying to load) and thats it. I feel bad for all of the blind people who can‚Äôt be helped because of the crappy software of this app. Don‚Äôt waste your time giving this app your information, it doesn‚Äôt work."
And I love knowing that I can help another in need as a volunteer too!
I just feel like I‚Äôm helping even when o don‚Äôt have a call for a long time.
I love doing nice acts just to make people‚Äôs day a little better. Found this on Reddit and I am super happy I stumbled upon it.
I downloaded this app over a month ago and I haven't gotten a call yet.  That is what I mean by it is good but not good for what it is supposed to be
This app is so beautiful!! I had my first call and it felt so good to be able to help someone on something so simple. This app is perfect and l love it.
I have helped several people and it is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. God Bless the inventors of this app.
"So incredible. I commend whoever thought up this app. What a truly great way to help others but also leave them with a feeling of independence. love, love, LOVE this app."
What a great idea! I love when technology can actually improve the quality of someone‚Äôs life.
I love helping people and I‚Äôve met some sweet people who are so appreciative of your help. They‚Äôve always been so friendly. I love volunteering.
So happy to have been helpful! Was able to help a woman go through her mail.
So rewarding thank you got my first call and hope for more opportunities to help soon!
Just being able to know i‚Äôm helping people who are visually impaired is the best feeling in the world.
I love the joy of helping people and If you do also install this app because it‚Äôs so joyful knowing you just made somebody‚Äôs day üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ
This app is so easy to use! Most calls are around 1 minute long. Very easy to help!
"All of us are born with different abilities and set backs, why not download a free app that allows you to help those all over the world!"
"What a wonderful tool so amazingly happy to be a part of this!!! Ive helped several folks so far, from can id to crock pot instruction... love it!!!"
"This app is an amazing opportunity to utilize technology to help our fellow humans out. Great stuff, wish more apps were this helpful."
"Wow, I just got my first call. Helped a gentleman set his alarm clock, and he was happy. 
It took 5 min of my day, and that time couldn‚Äôt have been better spent. 

Well done to whomever came up with the concept to fulfill the needs through such a simple and effective app.

#MakingItHappen"
"It‚Äôs a great app and an amazing thing, but when you get a call the call tone isn‚Äôt that loud."
Love the idea! I wish I got more opportunities to receive calls!
I must say it is such a rewarding feeling to assist someone on this app. I love this concept and encourage everyone to join.
"What a great way to contribute, and help our fellow human beings when they need it!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This app is amazing, just the idea of it, people helping people"
This app is great very helpful an volunteers are always friendly
I am honored to be able to help the seeing impaired with anything they ask of me.
Very user-friendly! Great way to be of service even in a pandemic!
Amazing opportunity for people to do a good deed for someone else and for someone to get help when needed!!
I think this is a great way to help. Especially. In these times
"It makes me so happy to get a call and help a complete stranger, even with something small. And the app is run well."
Fantastic app! I‚Äôve only been called on once but it was a great experience. I wish I got more requests!
"I hate to complaint but I download this app the day it come out, ever sense I have maybe revive only hand full of calls but ever sense in the last year this app has been wasting space in my phone, if I knew this was going to be the case I would of had volunteer in my church more soon. Smh"
I love this app. The video portion always works great. Just wish more requests would come through.
"Such a natural, lovely use of technology that‚Äôs an honor to use. Quick, effective and a great experience for the caller and the assistant. More apps like this, please."
Only way I wish it was different is if I could help more often. An amazing app
The stories alone will make you download this app. The opportunity to make a difference is priceless.
"AFTER MONTHS I FINALLY GOT TO THE CALL FIRST!

A blind dude couldn't figure out a new elevator interface so I spotted the buttons for him. Such a micro adrenaline rush to finally be the first responder to the notification.

Download this app, forget, then be notified of your chance to help! Join the 1.5 million who are on call for 100k. The future is pretty dope.
#BeMyEyes

So stoked."
"I just singed up to volunteer, my Nona is blind and am hoping to save up money to buy her an iPhone of her own so she use the app, too!"
To know about this amazing toll when you can be part of people daily live‚Äôs and help them üíï
My one call (so far) went well; I helped a low-vision guy sort his mail.
I get SO excited every time I get a call! I think this app is an amazing way to remember to value what a lot of people take for granted.
"It‚Äôs a wonderful app , I helped 5 to 6 people till now and they really have been happy to have an app like this"
Easy to use and very rewarding!
It‚Äôs an all around great app and great concept. Can‚Äôt wait to help more people in need
"What an experience to help someone in need, in the instance that they needed you. I am so grateful for my health and for my senses."
"Had this app installed for over a month and never got a single request for help from a kind person. Would‚Äôve loved to help, but it just takes up storage space on my phone."
This app doesn‚Äôt even give 30 seconds for a person to get to their phone and go through the steps to answer it. Very discouraging.
It‚Äôs an honor and privilege to volunteer I only wish I received more opportunities to help those individuals whom are blind or have visual impairments.
I have received 4 calls to assist. Every time I answer someone else has answered the call. It‚Äôs very frustrating when I want to help and I try to answer as fast as I can. It says connecting. But has never connected. I‚Äôm tempted to delete the app.
I‚Äôve had the app for a year!
"I was so excited to answer the call but when I picked up it was playing pornography on the other side. I was so shocked and humiliated and angry and disappointed. 

Such mixed feelings. I was so aspired by this app and truly want to help some day. 

I was trying to do good but experienced bad thing. I don‚Äôt wanna blame the app, but this type of thing needs to be stopped.

Why and how it could happen?"
Love this app and love that you can form a community and help others at any time.
It‚Äôs time we have apps like this! So great to see the ratio of blind to seeing people! I can‚Äôt wait to get my first call!
Omg I downloaded this and the first thing I do on it is help an old lady pick out her dress for a date and I‚Äôm still dying she was so happy!!!!
Thank you for creating this app. I just helped my first elderly and it was a wondrous experience.
"Doesn‚Äôt bother you too often, but it is a great idea and a great way to help out a vulnerable community"
"This is so cute, especially just the simple tasks people ask of you. 
Bless whoever made this."
"Just another app to take up space on the phone and collect information.  Signed up to be a volunteer and literally received no phone calls.  Why have an app constantly running, taking up space, for it to not even be used?"
"Easy, fast, no worries if you aren‚Äôt able to pick up; another volunteer will!"
"This app is so awesome. What a wonderful way to help others. 

Thank you"
This is just the greatest thing ever.  It's such a privilege to be able to give in this way.  Thanks to the creators of this!
This is a wonderful thing. I love being a seeing volunteer. Warmed my heart. This is a must have app. So well made and thought out.

I love the app and the concept but I wish I got more calls to help more people.

I love helping people and this just makes it so much better
Such an amazing app that provides another easy way to help other people out.
I just got my first call a few minutes ago and it was exhilarating. This is a amazing app.
"I am so happy that my eyes can help a person in need, I love this app! little actions make big changes"
I love everything about this app! So happy I came across it and love to be able to help others!
Any time you can make an app that will help others then it‚Äôs a very good app
This app is very innovative. I‚Äôve received about 5-6 calls since I joined and I love every experience about.
This App is giving the visually impaired so much freedom and independence. Being a volunteer on this app is easy and a great way to help others any time.
I‚Äôve only got to answer one call so far but it‚Äôs been by far the best experience I‚Äôve ever had! Was so happy to help!!
I recently help someone on the app and it went every well. I highly recommended this app!!!
I live that this app allows me to actively help people in a way that is easy for them and convenient for me. Wonderful.
I gave 5 star because love this concept Old UI is far better than this one
Everyone should have this app
"Told some dude it was safe to cross the road, the crossing timer went out and he believed me. My mans got obliterated. üòÇ"
I have had nothing but wonderful experiences and the volunteers are super.
"as the ‚Äúeyes‚Äù for spouse, I understand how valuable this app can be.
unfortunately, I get called so infrequently that I forget how to answer and thus lose every call."
"I‚Äôm a volunteer and I love this app , it makes you feel usefull so If you wanna to have a good day , download this appüòçüòçüòçüòç"
The idea for an app like this is what will change the world. 10/10 this slaps
A pervert called me and unfortunately I was available to answer the call.  These kinds of situations are unavoidable when using this app.  Do NOT let children download this app. I will be deleting this app so this doesn‚Äôt happen to me again.
Love this idea and app. Makes it so easy to help those in need.
It‚Äôs amazing being able to help someone!
I can‚Äôt think of a more useful or thoughtful app!
The creators of this app deserve a nobel peace prize for ‚Äúcaring‚Äù enough to create a wonderful connection tool to help those see what they can‚Äôt. Cheers and 3 thumbs up
Great app couldn‚Äôt think of a better way to use technology
"This app is truly amazing!! I am beyond glad to say that this app is truly helpful, kind, caring to many helpless people out there!"
This is a great way to easily contribute to the life of others in a helpful way!
"Took a while before I got my first call, but it was very worth the wait."
Such an amazing app! Quick and easy download too
How easy to answer a call and assist someone!
Good people doing good things. The world needs more apps (and the people who build apps like this) in it.
Very rewarding and really makes a person realize how much we take for granted in our day to day.
I love this app. I hope other engineers follow their lead and find ways for technology to help those who need it.
What a wonderful app. I‚Äôm so thankful to help and it was an awesome experience and easy to answer.
Easy to use I‚Äôve only been contacted once felt great to help. Great tech.
I love this idea and can‚Äôt wait to help someone.
This app is so amazing and selfless. I love answering and helping ppl do everyday things. It‚Äôs very humbling and such a good deed. Thanks to the creators of this app!
Feel great‚ò∫Ô∏è
Was able to help a man figure out the air conditioning in a motel. It‚Äôs the small things that really help.
"The one call I've ever received was either dropped (I was out shopping but connected to WiFi) or answered by someone else. I wish the developers or orchestrators would increase the users so we can be helpful. You know, unless the app doesn't work or isn't a good idea..."
"I have a month with the app now and as of today I still haven't receive a call or any type of notification of anyone needing help. The app is just taking space on my phone, I have no use of it. Might delete the app since it seems to not work or nobody needing help ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Such an amazing way to help those that cannot physically see. It is amazing how technology provides such a helping hand. ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
Easiest way to do go and feel good!

I always get awesome service as well as very respectable people volunteering to assist me. I love this app
Great way to give back

You‚Äôre here from that one tiktok and now you‚Äôre downloading the app
I get to help people just by my phone it‚Äôs get five stars from me
I have no received a call yet but I‚Äôm eager to. I hope this app is reaching as many visually impaired people as possible.
This is an amazing app & connects us in such an important way. Everyone should have this!
"I haven‚Äôt had the chance to help yet, but what a pure cause, thank you for creating it and maintaining it."
I'm so happy to be a part of this and had a great experience with my first call!
"Glad someone thought of this, happy to help some folks"
This app has amazed me with how I have been able to help people. Keep up the good work.
What a concept for an app! Glad there are people doing things like this in the world
"Wonderful app for blind people, and for sighted people that want to help others!"
I love this app. Makes you feel like you‚Äôre doing something good for the community.
Just had my first opportunity to help someone! So easy and quick! Love this app!
I just wish the app wouldn‚Äôt continually log me out.
I helped someone who needed help seeing their television audio equipment. This app is an excellent idea!
I‚Äôm very happy to be a part of Be My Eyes community and pleased to hear they‚Äôve teamed up with Moovit to help in even bigger way! Keep it up!
Thanks for developing this great concept and app. It is so rewarding to be able to help in such a way.  Keep up the great work!
App is wonderful and everybody that I have had contact with was friendly very nice and helpful.
So easy to use and so easy to be of help to someone.
Received my first call today! What a blast to help someone out....
Tech put to a valuable use
Had it for months now! Super simple to use and it always feels great to get a call.
Just knowing I can help people is beautiful honestly and put a smile on someone‚Äôs face is lovely.
I‚Äôve had the privilege of helping some individuals who are visually impaired. It‚Äôs amazing knowing you make a difference in this persons life.
Missed my first call üòïbut I can‚Äôt wait for my next chance to helpüòÉüëç.  Thank you
Really amazing and rewarding to be able to help others
I wish there were more apps like this.
We need more things like this in the world. This is what modern technology should aspire to.
"What a simple, yet amazing concept... a communication tool that connects people with a need to those ready to help!"
I just got my first call and I‚Äôm so happy. I love helping people.
Getting a call is like a surprise visit from an old friend.  I love it.
I feel so special when I can help someone.
Tremendous invention to allow people to help others. Thank you. Bravo!
This is a great initiative and improves the self esteem while being useful to others.
i think this is a fantastic idea and I love being a volunteer.
Makes me feel like I‚Äôm doing good in life and I‚Äôm contributing to society
10/10
..An ap that can help the world. 5 stars isn't enough
Wow can‚Äôt believe how awesome this app is. The fact that people all around the world are here to help us very nice.
What happened to humanity?
I had the app running for months and got two total calls.
If the app does not work and always shows loading just download and reinstall that did it for me
"I just got this app and I love it! Haven‚Äôt even gotten a call yet, lol. I‚Äôm only 14 so it feels great to have something to help out!"
Works well only got to help once in 2 years
Great App! It takes a minute to help someone live a better life!
"I just totally love this app, I recommend it to all my visually impaired friends"
Awesome App!! Something I can give back to the community
Been a member since 2014 getting calls makes my day better...
My alerts only lasted about one second. It went away so fast that I didn‚Äôt get a chance to pick it up. I think the Notification should last a little longer.
"Thanks a lot for your creativity and brilliant in creating such a fabulous app.
Keep the lights on."
What a wonderful feeling when helping people ‚ô•Ô∏è
Keep it up and keep helping
I just answered my first call and was able to identify the bottles for the nice woman who called.  What a great use of technology!
"Amazing app, a great way to help people!! I got my first ‚Äúbe my eyes‚Äù call two weeks ago and it honestly felt amazing to help."
This has been a lifesaver for me. Thank you all so much for volunteering and helping someone like me.
We need more developers like this. There is no greater cause then helping those who need help.
Just helped someone go through their mail. Such a nice experience.
Well made app. An example of how a simple digital design solution can positively impact and transform lives!
Very useful and makes you feel better
"Awesome üëèüèª App For The Blind!!!
Connects with a sighted person who can assist with whatever the blind person üßë‚Äçü¶Ø needs!!! 
Genius Idea üí° I Love ‚ù§Ô∏è Volunteering!!!!"
Makes you feel so accomplished.
Love that this is an option for people who wanna help from the safety of they home.
"To change from volunteer status, security checks, to not having any support groups...
I don‚Äôt want somebody from this site to be my eyes and I see no way of turning that status off?"
It feels so good to be able to help someone else just for the sake of doing good!!!
"Amazing amazing app feels great to be able to give a helping hand this way,"
"As a blind person, all my life I have had to rely on family and friends to read things for me, look at things for me, and so on. There is a constant level of guilt at having to ask for help and depend on people, and always an ongoing calculation about whether something really needs to be looked at or read or known, or whether something else has a higher priority, or whether I shouldn‚Äôt bother somebody right now so they will be more willing to help me the next time when I need it more urgently or something.
First, the introduction of FaceTime made it so I could ask help from people who weren‚Äôt necessarily with me, which made living alone easier, but still had all the same problems as above.
And then this app came along. This app completely changes the game. There are tens or hundreds of thousands of people around the world willing to help, and most likely the same person will never be overburdened by requests for help. Every volunteer I have ever spoken with using this app has been helpful, courteous, and straight up lovely. And from simple requests to read food packaging, to looking at displays or LEDs on computers I was repairing, reading and image captcha, or looking at a small display on an electronic device, all have been most helpful, patient, and understood exactly what they needed to tell me.
If you are cited and you download this app, God bless you, and you have my thanks in advance whether I ever speak to you or not. The developers of this app have done something that will be (and is) life-changing for so many."
I love this app. It‚Äôs great to feel like you can help someone with such a simple task.
I think this app will help so many people across the world and I am grateful an app like this exists.
This app is really cool especially when it comes to helping other people with just an app!
I rarely get calls but when I do I‚Äôm so excited to help. This app is a blessing and I enjoy it!
It‚Äôs so impressive to see creative people coming together to help others. Great idea & happy to volunteer
They are doing great things and Im glad I am able to help others with it.
Such an easy helpful to others app.  Seriously easy!
"If you are blind or have low vision and don't have this app, get it now! It means never getting stuck anywhere with nobody around where  the one piece of information is a sign, or something, that you have no way of accessing. It is just amazing that so many people have volunteered to be part of this that you can call on them almost anytime and get someone right away. With the tap of one button. I've used them to read error messages on a new computer when the built-in speech would not start, to look over the manual for a new product, to read the menu in a restaurant which was not on-line, while I was waiting for a friend, and to tell what color a little indicator light was. But I can think of so many places this would have been helpful, and it's really nice knowing I won't get stuck again. Like when the bus isn't coming and there's a print sign about it that I can't read, when an office is closed and there is a sign on the door, when I want to grab a bite to eat and it would normally take me a half hour of poking around  on my phone to figure out what's in the neighborhood, I could just call someone and have *them* look around. And so much more. All the little things that can cause so much trouble just don't have to be a problem.  I particularly appreciate being able to work with volunteers to whom I am anonymous and therefore are doing this for their own reasons, maybe just to contribute to the better good, instead of people who kind of expect an ongoing relationship of gratitude. It is much more dignified. Thanks to all the volunteers who do give their time this way."
"Amazing technology I really loved helping someone else. It made me feel great to tell her what present arrived for her dog , her dog was very happy to and very cute"
I just love helping people on this app! It totally makes my day!
I had this App before. I decided to try again. There's been issues with getting connected with the angel that I'm supposed to help. I sure hope they fixed that issue.
"Hello guys, this app is an amazing product. Haven‚Äôt used it for the last couple of years. But this app is still awesome. The fact that you have helped 24 hours is grateful"
"I got a call a couple days ago . It felt nice to help someone out . 
Great app"
"Downloaded it during College in NYC, & It Opened My Eyes to a World full of Possibilities‚ùï"
I get upset when someone beats me to a call because I‚Äôm so anxious to help my brothers and sisters in need....
I am a blind person who needs this app. Keep up the good work. Thankyou.
Amazing idea! I love the chance to help some in need! I‚Äôm glad someone can get the help they need.
I think it‚Äôs a great concept but I have had this app for about 3 months and only received 1 call with which I couldn‚Äôt answer because someone beat me to it! I so badly want to help but seems as if there is no need for me
Only gotten one call so far but the app worked well! Love what this app provides!
"What is the point on having this waste of space app? I just want to help people and I‚Äôve had this crap for months, and I‚Äôve yet to receive a call. Like seriously? This is ridiculous."
Just download it.  Help someone out every so often.  Make the world better.
I am happy to give so little to a person who need a helping app.
I‚Äôm so happy to be with y‚Äôall to give help to People who need it my deepest prayers for all humans and all Creatures of God for Full Health and Full Happiness Forever Amine Amine Amine ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

A beautiful way to help people from all over.
"Wonderful app, super easy to be helpful (randomly) now and then."
This is an amazing resource!
I think this app is amazing . Such an easy way to help someone in need ‚ù§Ô∏è
Deleting the app now! It doesn‚Äôt even give you time to answer. I would‚Äôve loved to have helped somebody.
i love how they are giving opportunities for people like me to help people in need
it gives people who are blind and visually impaired a lot more independent so thank you for that
It‚Äôs such a great feeling to be able to help someone so quick in such a meaningful way.
"when you get a call it might be the most heartfelt, warm, thankful feeling ever!!! Must download!!"
"Got a call tonight from something sounding automated like never before, saying they couldn‚Äôt see my on my camera. I‚Äôve tried to contact the company and no one has called me back. Very unsettling and won‚Äôt be using again.

This could be sex trafficking"
I am  so happy that there is someone who can help me thru my shopping it has been a Blessing
This is the good application for blindness people if they need assistance I will totally recommend this app
"This App is great except for the fact that the notification ringer is not loud enough. I miss have the calls made, Mahalo"

You can really make a difference in someone‚Äôs life!
"Such a simple way to help others. With do much crap in the world, you can easily feel good by doing a good deed."
What an amazing service. Thank you for the opportunity to help.
"This is an amazing app but would be nice if you add bilingual or multiple languages ‚Äã‚Äãso I can help English, Portuguese and Spanish, simultaneously"
Love this app! I've enjoyed helping kind people across the country. Highly recommend joining the movement.
"Fluid, easy to use and such a blessing to be able to help someone else!"
"Honestly, a joy to be apart of this program."
Thank you for allowing me this opportunity!
I have only gotten one call so far but I love helping:)
"i like the app.. i love to help people but no one ever needs any help. a couple times it alerted me but by the time i pushed it to help (i pushed it as soon as the notification popped up) someone else already got them.
i don‚Äôt wanna give a bad rating but a 5 star isn‚Äôt it."
One of the most important apps in my phone. The only app that allows me to directly help someone
Love the app! should really consider making an app for the deaf community!! Volunteers could help them communicate;)
It is really rewarding being able to help someone else!
I low key bought this just outta the hope i can get calls and talk to people
"Wow, what an experience answering my first call. I was excited and honored that I was able to help someone. Love this app!"
I this is so awesome and I‚Äôm loving the opportunity to help out.... Just wish I get more calls....

This app was real helpful to me. It has come to my rescue a couple times. It‚Äôs very simple and easy to use. Welcome one

I believe this app helps so many people. Volunteers and blind users.

"Just signed up, excited to get my first call!"
"I answered my first call today and it was such an amazing experience! IF YOU ARE NOT SIGNED UP, YOU NEED TO BE! You could help someone!"
I love how it feels to help be someone‚Äôs sight in such an intimate way.
I‚Äôm a volunteer and there is so many of us and because of that you don‚Äôt get to help out a lot of people. But I love the idea!
The people on the app have never contacted me and I want to help so how do I get more people to call me
I downloaded this app yesterday and I got my first call today.
What a blessing to be able to help people all over the world.
I love how easy it is too connect with someone who needs help
Just downloaded this app tried to use it to find Jell-O in the fridge but nobody answered. Needs more volunteers please if I am at work and need something I can‚Äôt be waiting all day.
This is a great app for blind and visually impaired people! I have recommended it to all of my blind and visually impaired friends great job! Kudos to the developers for developing this app.
Awesome app. Received my first call today. Makes you feel good to help someone.
"DUDE THIS APP IS THE BEST THING EVER. I just answered my first video call to help someone change the settings on their air conditioning and it was successful, beyond POWERFUL. This is brilliant."
I‚Äôm a volunteer and it‚Äôs so rewarding and easy to help someone out! Whoever invented this is a genius! App is easy to use as well!
Im happy bc we can help people when we download this app
Love that I can be a volunteer on my phone!
üíãü•∞ I love it it really does feel good help even if it just a simple task.
"Super easy to set up, super easy to use. What a great idea!"
Very heartwarming to actually help the blind even the smallest things
Help please it won‚Äôt even let me create an account and it keeps saying time out error I know for a fact it‚Äôs. It my internet or WiFi my phone is working perfectly fine with any other app
I just got my first call today
I have been a member for at least 2 or 3 months and I ha e not gotten one single call. When I first got the app I was so excited to help people because I love helping but now I‚Äôm just really sad I never got to help or even got a call.
A perfect way to be helpful and compassionate! Such a wonderful tool to help the visually impaired.
I love this. This is what we should be using technology for.
One of the best apps ever.  I love answering calls to help blind people finding their way to solve daily tasks.
Such a great service and I am so thankful to be a tiny tiny part of helping someone maintain a sense of independence!
"I‚Äôm 10 and wanna know if I can help, because it says I have to be 17, can I use the app or do I have to delete it?"
Was excited to use this app but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get to. Went to select my language and it loaded for several seconds before throwing up an error modal. I can‚Äôt get past this so I guess I won‚Äôt use it?
"I am a volunteer and I really like this App. I have so far helped 3 people and I hope it continues.

S"
"As a volunteer I‚Äôm happy to report how easy this is to set, use and assist someone."
"I have helped 4 people so far, and it has been a great experience. 
I am happy to help ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Love helping out when i can !
Really great way of helping others
I cant help if the app just never loads completely :(
Every time I try to use it to help people out it won‚Äôt let me create an account it just says error with no explanation even if I sign up with google/Apple/Facebook
"No matter how quick you are at answering, it‚Äôll always say someone else answered the call."
I‚Äôve been getting a bunch of inappropriate calls where it‚Äôs just random guys showing there dicks!! If this what this app is going to be about instead of helping the blind that‚Äôs stupid.
tried to answer 2 calls and was unable to. I actually got this app to help people not to just have the app.
It is so helpful  when I am trying to cross a street.
"It feels good to help people, and this app makes a difference üíó"
This is just sooo beautiful knowing that someone started this app and the thought of it and it‚Äôs amazing . I love it ü•∞
This is a wonderful app and I‚Äôm glad to be able to help someone.
This is so revolutionary and heart warming! I just got my first call. This is such an awesome technology and simple but powerful way to spread positivity!
Such a great feeling after you are able to assist someone üòä
"I‚Äôve been a member for over a month and have never received a call.  While this is a great idea and I‚Äôd love to help, I‚Äôm thinking either a) there is not much demand for this service or b) the app is broken"
I‚Äôm still new but I got my first experience today and I felt so good üòçüòç
Loved being able to help !!!
"This app would be really useful, but every time I call in, I get someone who is in a super big hurry and gets mad at me because I can't point a camera. Hello, this app is for people who have trouble with their vision, not camera pointing experts"
My one and ONLY complaint is that I can‚Äôt help more!!! I love this and the community it brings together!! Thanks for the awesome app!!
Got my first call and helped a lady to read a letter. What wonderful app this is.
Got a call and tried to answer but the app had logged me out and it took over 5 mins to sign back in.
Love helping people. This makes it so simple. It is the little things that make life awesome!
Great way to have technology on your side.
I volunteer and this app is amazing. This app is basically sharing kindness and I love that.
The community on this app is amazing! I absolutely love being a volunteer on such a great app and helping others.
The home screen is just stuck in what looks like constant refresh. I‚Äôve downloaded and deleted and re downloaded a few times and it does the same thing every time.
I love the feeling I get when I help the ones in need. And all thanks to this app.
Thank you for letting us help other ones to see the world. I am truly honored to be a volunteer.
"I haven‚Äôt received a call yet, but I just signed up. Awesome idea! Way to go, devs!"
This is a great app for both volunteers and the users!
Wonderful app and it's so nice to help othersüíö
I absolutely love this app. I love being a help to others
Want to help ready and willing look forward to the chance üôèüèΩ

I Absolutely love everything about this

Feels so good to have an app to help other people with their life quality.
This is what the internet and video chatting was built for. The betterment of the world!  Be my eyes is just that.
I downloaded this app after seeing a post about it on Facebook. I was excited to help people that needed it but the home page will not load and I am very disappointed. Please fix it as soon as possible! I would love to help!
This is such a wonderful service. I‚Äôm so glad to be a part of it.

I never get any calls. üòî
I am happy with my first call today!!!!! I feel so helpful
"Heard of the app on Dr Oz yesterday 
I am in Atlanta 
Downloaded the app 
Got a call today 
Caller was a woman ( probably in UK) needing assistance with reading the labels on some frozen food 
She was no nice and polite 
Felt great to have been available to help her 
Entire transaction took a minute or so"
"I‚Äôve only used it once so far, but Be My Eyes is already my favorite app!!!"
Every experience has been amazing!
Seriously the smoothest and coolest app!  What a joy and privilege to be a part of something so simple and so vastly important!
This is literally one of the best things technology can do.
I feel so blessed to be part of the good this app brings around the world!
Thank you for creating such a thoughtful app.
Great app to help others!
üòä
Glad that I can help people
Had to sign up when I saw this app. What a life changer
Every time I get a call to help it is the best part of my day.
"So far, it is the best thing to assist someone immediately in need."
Amazing to help and it is so rewarding! I get so excited to get a call!
To lend my eyes in helping the blind makes me humble when I moan and groan about having to wear glasses... ü§ì
"A lot of good changes it seems like there are more volunteers, calls are answered rather quickly."
The tutorial is easy to follow
Great app. Still waiting for my first call ‚òπÔ∏è
"Easy to use, and love helping others"
I‚Äôve had great experiences with this app I think it‚Äôs the best invention since the wheel!
Thank you for creating such an amazing app
What a great app!
Such a wonderful experience
"I‚Äôve only ever gotten one call to help someone. It seems pointless to keep the app on my phone. Will probably delete, although I do want to help people."
I haven‚Äôt had a call but love the cause!
What a wonderful concept for an app. Absolutely amazing and heartwarming.
I‚Äôm looking forward to helping someone!
Amazing to see society using the privilege of eye sight to help those who do not
"i just saw this app someone showed it from social media so i immediately downloaded it. im a volunteer and i really love the idea of this app. it makes me so enlightened to know there are good people,  i cant wait to help!"
This app is the coolest thing EVER! I love getting calls and helping people out!
Best app i have on my phone!! Make me feel grateful for what i have!
This app lets me give in a way I couldn‚Äôt before! So amazing !
Great way to give a little back to the world.
Five stars all the way great to be able to help
One of the best apps  I ever used and it has been my favorite app for my iPhone
Love volunteering my time to such kind people. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Am incredible way to serve ü§ç
Sad I don‚Äôt get more calls );
This is my favorite app of all times.
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things. By far, most valuable App and it‚Äôs FREE! WOW! Thank you!!!!"
If you Really love help out those in need of it this app is for you
Amazing app. Glad to see such application. Keep up the good work
This app is fantastic. No blind person should be without it.
Was excited to download this and help people. After two months I got my first call. It was a pervert who was indeed completely sighted trying to have a sexual conversation. So disappointed there is no way around this.
Love being able to help someone maintain their independence. Great app!
I think this is a great idea and we need more acts of kindness like this is the world! ‚ù§Ô∏è
It would be able to see you ‚Äòprofile‚Äô or edit your shared info in the app
Sorry to say that I downloaded this app to help needy and  it never helped. In 6 months I got around 6 calls and each time it never connected me to anyone.
so i Love the concept of Idea but you have never received a call wich makes me so sad i wanna help people!!!
What a great service to help others with our Smartphones! - Tim
Amazing way to help anyone in need from anywhere!
This app has allowed a new avenue for me to teach my children kindness.
Happy to be able to use this app.
I love this app! I have two sight impaired sisters and this is a wonderful tool for people to use!
"It‚Äôs a neat concept, but opportunities to help are rare. I‚Äôve had the app set up for several months and have only gotten one request to help."
"Not sure if I‚Äôm helping, but I try and I love the concept."
I love this opportunity to help others! I wholeheartedly recommend this app!!!!
"I am a sighted person, and I loved the idea I could help some one who needed it. Great App!"
Such a little great way to help out.
Awesome app to help the visually impaired. Shared with one of my visually impaired customers and she loves it!!
What a service
See for your self It‚Äôs amazing
Love how it promotes accessibility to the blind! Recommend becoming a volunteer like I did
Such an amazing app that‚Äôs geared towards helping those in need!
It‚Äôs a cool app that can help people that aren‚Äôt able to see and it‚Äôs for a good cause
This was such an amazing idea. I‚Äôve helped many people.
I love this app. I have received several calls and was happy to assist.
Great concept but calls seem to be coming from sighted people looking to sexually harass others. There has to be a better way to do this.
So easy to use as a volunteer.
So happy to be a part of this wonderful thing
I love this tool. I can help others without much effort too!!!
"Great concept, BUT it‚Äôs been months and I haven‚Äôt gotten one request. Is anyone actually being helped? Are you actually sending any of the requests out?"
An app that assures me that l am giving back
Helped a guy turn his heat off this summer!
Love helping when I can.
Like I stated in the title it is very helpful to the blind community
I think this app is something marvelous Genius I applaud thee
An amazing way to give back and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù during covid - 19!
It actually works
"Answered my first call to see someone in a bathroom. He asked me where his toilet was, I said to the right, and then he proceeded to urinate without hanging up the line! There is no way to filter this out so beware."
This is honestly the best use of smartphone yet. Helping people in simple ways. Brilliant!
"Satisfaction of helping someone, thanks to the creator!"
There has to be more blind people who can use this app. Spread the word!
A perfect way to connect the visually impaired with a volunteer who can help. It's simply awesome!
Great way to serve and help those who need the help. The process is simple. I love this app!
Why don‚Äôt they remove this app it never works I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it
"Amazing app 
Very thoughtful of founder 
Safe and reliable to use
Works well and great for the blind.
üòçüòç"
Just  amazing the thought of the app .
What a great service for those in need. Genius.
Just wanted to say this is a wonderful app idea & am proud to be a volunteer!
Freezes
"Only had the privilege to assist twice, but love the opportunity."
Simply a good app that truly helps people and works correctly. Perfect.
Love it. Got my first call in 2 days.
Don‚Äôt wait. Volunteer today!
Easily help others in need of your sight!
This app is awesome. Such a neat concept and I‚Äôm so happy to be able to be apart of it all!
"Haven‚Äôt gotten a call yet, however, I adore the app‚Äôs idea."
Its easy! It‚Äôs fun!  It helps someone!
I wish I‚Äôd come up with such a special kind of app!
"this is by far the greatest application I have ever found for an iPhone sincerely, Ms. April Struhm."
Wonderful to help people!
I am a volunteer and I love this app.
This is an amazing app to help in any way possible
This is the best app I have come across for the blind.
"Great App! 
Especially if you are willing to help the people in society"
Be my eyes is an awesome app and I love it but it takes so long to get a call but that‚Äôs ok!
Wonderful idea! Glad I can be part of it üíï
Love the App. I hope that it is really helpful for people that need it.
The Microsoft Support I got was the Best.  Please Never Let this option go.
What a wonderful app! Blessings to whomever created Be My Eyes!
The best app ever created! This is real ! I love this everything on this app is positive! ‚ù§Ô∏è
i‚Äôm so happy this app is a thing. thank you to whom made it ü§©
I love the work we volunteers do..  thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
It is helpful
Love feeling like I‚Äôm truly helping someone!!!
Confused
"Such a wonderful app, and I am so grateful I could help! üñ§"
Such an amazing app. It‚Äôs impactful to make a difference just by answering a call
"for a sighted volunteer, the app is easy to use and a really nice way to have small opportunities to help others throughout the day. highly recommended!"
I signed up and everything and I have my notifications on and it never tells me that someone‚Äôs requesting for help like I joined like a few weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt done anything
"It‚Äôs too bad your sign-up is not accessible. If you would have the up arrow, down arrow, and down buttons above the keyboard, I could actually see what fields I am filling in besides the first one."
I love this app! 5 stars
It‚Äôs the best feeling to be able to help someone.
This is a great app. Simple and easy. Plus you get to help people.
"i‚Äôm in looove with the idea of this app
but on my first call 2problems happend with me
the  first one is : the quality of the video        ( i did not help him)
the second is : in the middle of the call something went wrong and the call is cut!!
i wish that you‚Äôll fix it guysüôèüèº‚ô•Ô∏è"
i‚Äôm a volunteer with this app. it‚Äôs really easy to help people and you get notifications infrequently enough it‚Äôs never intrusive. 10/10 do recommend
Be my eyes is such and clever and useful tool and I thoroughly enjoy volunteering on it.
Haven‚Äôt gotten any calls yet but I LOVE the idea!
Love to see technology being used for such a good cause!!!
I feel really good about this
"Great app
Thank you for helping"
This app is not only genius but it‚Äôs really heart warming
"Love this app, free way to help others :)"
I can‚Äôt login! It just gives me a timeout error. I searched for some way to report this instead of a review but wasn‚Äôt able to find anything. üò¢
Excellent group! Thank you to the Be My Eyes team for all you do!
"Great app, we all should use it."
So thrilled to help people in need!
This is such a wonderful idea for helping the blind. The problem I have witnessed is that the call is transferred to another volunteer too quickly to answer with any success.
"Love this app , it makes me feel so good to help üôÉ super great app !"
this app is so good and wholesome this is one of the best apps that i‚Äôm gonna use.
For some reason it won‚Äôt let me sign up it just keeps saying time error. Does anyone know how to fix that?
Thank you to whomever made this app.
A great help for those in need
"The help I can give, it‚Äôs wonderful!"
Amazed by this app and what it accomplishes. I‚Äôm honored to be a very small part of it.
Love it. The world needs more tech like this.
It feels good to be able to help someone
No issues
I got my first call. I was so happy to help!
This app is sick love helping blind ppl
This is a great application that delivers.
This app literally gives meaning to my life
"I never get calls / 
Got one call someone else answered in one sec"
"As a totally blind person, this app is amazing!"
"I would really like to use this app, but the home page will not stop showing a refresh/loading sign. Please fix this!!!!"
"Although i havent gotten the chance to help someone, its cool."
My first call was amazing
A great app that is doing amazing work. 10/10!
This is such an amazing app! Always happy to help those in need of assistance.
I love being able to help

Wished they used me more

This is a great organization. Proud to be a volunteer üòÉ
Loveeeeeeeee the fact we can help visually impaired people on this app!! So beautiful!!
Always happy to assist someone.
I was so excited for my first call! But unfortunately it wouldn‚Äôt connect. So sad
Whoever started this app should get a Nobel peace prize
So easy and so meaningful.
Everyone should have this app!
This app is an amazing gift and I love helping the people that use it üôå
I‚Äôm honored to be able to help the visually impaired with this amazing app!
A fantastically simple way to help those in need.
I love being a volunteer for Be My Eyes!
Great for the blind very easy to navigate
It‚Äôs been a month and I still have not got a call so the app is not worth it
Such an amazing app! There should be more apps like these.
"This is an awesome app!!!!!
A simple way to help other human beings. 

There are so many helpers in the network that the users don‚Äôt get many calls...üò¢

Kudos to the developer."
Great way to help someone in need of help
Thank you for make this app to help people
"I am a volunteer and have received two calls from which I‚Äôm disconnected before the call gets through, a block message reads trouble  connecting. :/"
Being able to assist any Visually Impaired or Blind Persons by means of an app is none short of a BLESSING!
I have had the app for a really long time. I have only received one call and about a computer issue where computers aren‚Äôt really my thing. I was sad
This app truly benefits me and other blind users!
I get to help the blind and visually impaired what‚Äôs not to live
So honored to be able to help!
poor quality
A great way to help people.
"All I want to do is help someone and not one call received yet!  I told my co worker about it, he set up an account and within two days he got a call.  :("
good but freezes a lot
Best app ever. Love the idea of helping people from anywhere.
I want to thank you for this useful applicationüëèüèº
To help others
I tried it and it's gone well . LOVE IT
I love meeting new people. The people on this app are amazing!
I was such a help to this wonderful gal who needed help with her stove in her new apt.! Made MY day!
I don‚Äôt ever leave reviews but this is truly a great app:)
being able to help people like this is absolutely stunning
It‚Äôs so beautiful and helpful
Just a beautiful display of human decency
I love the idea of this app
Love how easy it is to help people
Awesome app. Makes it very easy to help
This is an amazing app for blind people to use
I‚Äôm delighted to help.
I love this app! Being a volunteer on here is so fun and rewarding! ü§ç
Just something that keeps my heart warm . Happy to help .
It has a really good concept but I feel like it‚Äôs just an app on my phone taking up space
Helped a couple people!!!  Awesome!
It keeps asking me to give a review but I‚Äôve had the app for about two weeks now and I haven‚Äôt received a call. So there‚Äôs nothing to rate.
App crashed while answering.
Can‚Äôt rate have never received a request.
"What‚Äôs not to like?  Strangers helping strangers, just because we can. LOVE IT!"
"A great app, and an awesome service!
Kudos to the founder, the team, and the many volunteers!"
I went to answer and app did not work
lovegolf45

Hi this is a great ap it helps me a lot Grait app
I love this
I think this is a great idea to help the blind! Cudos to the developers!
"I rarely get a call , had the app for over a year  and only got like 3 calls"
I got a notice that someone needed help but the app won‚Äôt load. It‚Äôs just spinning and spinning. Your app is useless if people aren‚Äôt able to get the help they need. Please fix this!
Great way to give back and help
Truly a blessing to help others!
i took my first call on here recently and it was the easiest good deed i‚Äôve done. i absolutely adore this app and would recommend it to everybody
I love this app
Have this app on my phone for 3 continuous years. I‚Äôve only ever gotten 2 calls! Both were between midnight to three am.....
This app is incredible! Such a blessing to so many.
The first call I received the guy was completely rude towards me. This is ridiculous when you are trying to help someone.
I downloaded this app thinking I could help others. I‚Äôve had one phone call and someone else answered it first. Not very helpful
I would suggest this to ANYONE!! It is such a rewarding experience.
A powerful tool that helps
"It‚Äôs nice to be connected to Be My Eyes. It‚Äôs easy to lend a little help, then get on with my day."
There is no need for a person who wants to help to get this app. I have had it for close to 5 months and haven‚Äôt gotten one call. I‚Äôm very sad and discouraged.
Love helping good connection
I love helping people so I really wanna thank the creator of this app !
It‚Äôs awesome that we can help someone in need.
Just thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
How do you only hold two people in your first time in the app
I downloaded this to help but it won‚Äôt even load. Sad to delete.
This is a great way to help others!
Love helping people and this app lets me
As someone that can help the visually disabled this is so cool. What an amazing idea.
It‚Äôs such an easy and cool way to help someone out. Love this.
"If you love to help

I just wish I was given an opportunity to help!
Thanks for creating this app!
A great app to help the visually impaired population
Amazing app by truly amazing people.
Wonderful service
I love this. What an easy gift.
I don‚Äôt get no calls maybe only got two in July but I really love helping people so I would like more calls
I think it‚Äôs a waste of space on my phone because I never get a call to help anyone.
Im a volunteer and this app is easy to use and it feels awesome to help :)
What an amazing resource for the blind and visually impaired community.
Best app ever. Please add it to your collection
"What‚Äôs the point of the app if the home screen just has a spinning wheel and never shows anything? 
DO BETTER!"
It‚Äôs great to be able to help the needy.
I have had the privilege to help 2 blind people!!
"i love this app, i feel so helpful all the time. it makes me so happy to know that i can help someone at any time in the day."
What an amazing idea....love this clever way to be of assistance to someone
Such a wonderfully wholesome concept
I was able to help somebody and it felt goooooood! lol
I downloaded it to instantly get a call but it‚Äôs been over 48 hours üòíüëéüèºüëéüèº
I don‚Äôt know what I. Did wrong I was  walking up the stairs.i  Tripped got off the app later down went back on and my account  was suspended
Love to serve others.... beautiful app indeed!
i love the general concept of this but i really wish they would add a text messaging only option for people who are anxious with calling but would still like to help;-;
This app is awesome. Easy way to help people in need. I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
"iv been a volunteer for a while and i received 1 call but i wasn‚Äôt able to answer it because someone took it for me when i was right about to answer, since then i haven‚Äôt received a single call. i wish i was able to help:("
"I would love to help, unfortunately I never get calls...I‚Äôm a little disappointed."
"Every time I answer a call, the call never starts. The screen keeps saying ‚ÄúAnswering call‚Äù but it never does."
"Great App, easy to use!"
This is what technology is for. Amazing idea and execution.
The 1st call instantly warmed my heart! This is an amazing app.
I‚Äôve been on this for a little over a month now and I‚Äôve never received anything
"Hi, I love the idea of the app and stuff but I‚Äôve had the app for months as a volunteer and still haven‚Äôt gotten any calls"
Just download it and help someone bro
Such a great way to help people
Love.
I am in a bad relationship and I need help.
I never get calls so what‚Äôs the point of this. You should be able to choose a user to help

a very useful and easy way to help people from your mobile
"if i could give this app 0 stars, i would. i‚Äôve been in this app for about a month now and NOT ONCE have i gotten a call. DO NOT GET THIS APP."
I downloaded it and nothing works except settings and stories.
"i love the concept but i‚Äôm not getting any calls?? like, i‚Äôve has this app all day and i haven‚Äôt even gotten one call??

Do not sign up for this. I received an inappropriate prank phone call yesterday. People are sadly misusing this application.
This is such a wonderful app!!!
Amazing App!! Keep up the great work
Finally an app that helps!
App went into background mode for blind person so they didn‚Äôt get help
Omg thanks to whomever created this app!!

Wonderful app!
Humbling. Wonderful experience ‚ù§Ô∏è
I like the app be my eyes berry much.
"Such a bummer to get beaten out on a call
;)"
What an amazing app!
I love helping people.
Had this app up a year. Not one call for help. I feel useless. Deleted.
this garbage won‚Äôt even load. I was so excited to try this out!
Amazing app. So rewarding to help someone.
This is the most amazing app ever. What a selfless jewel
"I have been enrolled to assist since October of 2018. Over the years I have answered many calls. Putting myself into each situation and encouraging each caller as I assist gives me a smile and knowing that I can help. 
I have answered 3 calls most recently that are things that (sighted) people might take for granted. 
1. A lady was given a new stove and needed to verify the knobs for burners, and that she had the oven on, and help setting the temperature and timer. We also verified the shelves located inside and we changed them. She was so excited to use her new stove, and I shared the excitement with her. 
2. An older woman was sick and had new medication brought to her from the pharmacy. She needed to read labels and take notes to be sure she was taking it correctly. 
I know braille might be very helpful if the label came that way. Maybe someone will invent it. I reassured her to call us if she was uncertain even a little bit. And with my (our) helping, she said it gave her so much relief from anxiety. 
3. A college student had a new computer given to her and it was set up for her sight issues. She had turned it on and could tell the color emitted was not what she was use to. I described the screen and explained in order the icons down the left side. I know about basic set up and we reviewed some things she needed to know had the vocal assist set up. We even changed the background color to what she had been use to on her other computer. I shared her excitement for her new gift. 

As I said simple to assist with but each were so grateful.

Very good application
There‚Äôs no way to send real help to people in need. Someone was accosted on my call and I can‚Äôt send help.
Good feeling to help
The best APP I ever used
I helped a nice lady cook rice! It was a really touching experience!
Love this
I‚Äôve been on here for weeks and haven‚Äôt gotten a single call to help.
"I am blind, and I do ask for help sometimes. Sometimes it's basic things, like reading labels, reading paper, etc at times, I ask for help reading my computer screen or a piece of technology allowed to me, so I can figure out how to diagnose the issue.

I have been noticing that when I called into be my eyes, some people I talk to have been rude towards me. Happens a lot when I ask someone to repeat information to me again to make sure that I heard things right, and when I ask for help navigating my computer screen and they know nothing about technology, as such, they get frustrated with me. One time, it was because I need to flip a switch on an electrical outlet and I could not feel that switch very well, the person I called asked me to call an electrician instead. However, sometimes it does happen that you make friends on the be my eyes app.

There are a few more things that I wish to be added in to this app. It would be cool if volunteers could help you take photos, and the photos they take can automatically be added into your library. Although I am not a volunteer, an I don't know how volunteers use this app, but I think it would be cool if they had the option to zoom in and pan around. I think that would be helpful to volunteers who have trouble reading extremely small text.

Be my eyes is a great place to ask for help when you need it. The thing is, is that you still, sometimes, have to try multiple times when you call. Furthermore, You still need to be careful because at times, you make it someone who is rude. But if you're willing to deal with that, it's still a good app to consider downloading for smaller, non-technical and non-private things."
This is a really good app
I love volunteering and helping with this app‚ù§Ô∏è
So simple. And so brilliant.
I love this app
nothing after months
"Who ever think of this idea, is a GENIUS."
You‚Äôll never get a call.
I know this app is to help people but I‚Äôve gotten prank calls instead...
I enjoy it
First call I answered grown guy was exposing himself! Do not sign up for this!!! How terrible! Here I thought I was doing a good thing by helping out!
Love helping the blind community
Bad app I answer my first call and it was a man asking about little girls underwear.. he wasn‚Äôt blind
I love how this is a free app to help the blind. It‚Äôs so good.
I never got a notification ever to help someone so there‚Äôs no point
It is a very helpful app
Home screen won‚Äôt load
Truly Amazing
It is such amazing all
I would write a good review if I got to use the app!
It just spins constantly never loads home screen
This is such a great thing!!!
I had my first call and it wouldn‚Äôt even connect.
Best feeling Pf this 2022 year
This app fills my heart with joy.
everyone should use this app
"Love this idea, such a blessing on both sides."
"First off; great job to the developer and their team. I can‚Äôt even say anything good (that‚Äôs new lol) about this system that hasn‚Äôt been said before a million people. I hope this app continues to serve and connect people and even get better at doing that as time goes by.

Which is why I thought I‚Äôd mention a couple ideas I thought the developer might find worthwhile implementing:

1. This would take minimal effort, but; I just thought it would be a good setting to add to the app to put volunteer status ‚Äúon hold‚Äù at designated times the user inputs, rather than having to manually log out and log back in every day so you don‚Äôt get a notification or call when you‚Äôre sleeping, in school, etc., and keeps people from having to remember to sign in every time.
2. General Tasks Descriptions/Specialty Knowledge Requests: I think adding a small list of general description scenarios (perhaps coordinating them to a number, and not speaking any number when making a call would just be usual ‚Äúmiscellaneous‚Äù as is) might help to give volunteers a better idea of wether they would be a great/best-avoided choice for the task at hand (under the not-so-common scenarios, it could probably save time for the requesters and volunteers from cycling through a match that can get the objective done; when a particularly special knowledge event requires assistance). This could maybe even go further by giving volunteers skill tables to be able to fill in; and when a special request call requiring knowledge in that field is made, volunteers with knowledge in that field could be alerted first. Example: Something like a ‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù tag and if a visually disabled person needed a pair of eyes to identify what is keeping them from navigating a voice controlled computer as normal, but a large amount of volunteers might need to also know how to navigate Windows 10 task manager, etcetera. 
Not a perfect example, but my point is just that if the developer and team has the resources and inspiration; perhaps something among those lines are a couple ideas of how they could continue to better the app and keep the world community doing the good stuff it does.
Peace All."
One of the best greatest app ever.
I‚Äôve had this app for over a year & ive only been contacted once & it was a joke
Ive gotten 3 prank calls in the last 3 days
I love this app!
"Finally got a call and was so excited to help someone, answered the call to find a dude exposing himself to me."
As soon as I made an account all of my information was leaked! DO NOT GET THIS APP
Amazing idea. Brilliant
Please add Punjabi to languages.
I love volunteering on this app!
Good idea but need got to even use the app.
Very fulfilling time spent.
"This app never works for me, unfortunately."
"Fantastic, a great app"
amazing texhnology and a great opportunity to give back
Great app! Great way to help blind ppl! Congrats
Good for all people
Loss of words
this app is truly life saving to all of the blind or visually impaired.
"Be my eyes is a great resource for the blind community, proud to be a volunteer"
App works great!
Awesome experience
Great
You never get connected to anybody
It wouldn‚Äôt let me accept the call
The Reason I‚Äôm Rated 1 Star!!!! Is Because I‚Äôve Had This App For A Month Now And Still Haven‚Äôt Received A Call
This is an amazing idea.
Great app!
The app is awesome but under 13. Please explain
Excellent way to be a blessing !!
never got a call. deleting app waste of space
Thanks For the opportunity
love this app and it‚Äôs concept
Not what I expected. Not contacted at all. Wanted to help not just have another app!
Easy to use..
Never get any calls
Its nice to help
thanks to this app i can help the blind
Hinc I stated uxihg oh btrrb a lot ofhelp so it‚Äôs gokn
Amazing app
"First call was so disorganized and I remember I didn‚Äôt help them as they wished, I was nervous, I failed and it‚Äôs a fuzz memory. 
Second call was a angry man with a strong accent. I could tell he didn‚Äôt like he was speaking to a soft spoken female American, I‚Äôve been a taxi driver and lived in many states here in the US, I don‚Äôt live in a glass houses, he needed a man to speak to. He continually spoke down to me and I finally stopped being peppy and super polite. At one point a male came into his room, they had a awkward negative exchange (why didn‚Äôt he ask the sighted person for help) and he angrily told the man to leave his room. He ended hanging up on me while I was speaking telling him basically I can‚Äôt help you. He needs a hug 
The third call was a heavy accented young guy whom I‚Äôm pretty sure was in his 20‚Äôs, oh to be 20 again. He was asking about his stacks upon stacks of perfectly folded boxer briefs, thinking this guy really needs help or is he being naughty with the app? He at one point gave out a nervous laugh, he kept asking me the same questions and finally got the undies he needed. He was polite, thanked me and was friendly through the entire call.
So I feel useless with the app since it‚Äôs all been odd experiences. I‚Äôve read comments where people have become friends, chatted for 10 minutes afterward and great heart warming stories that make ya just tear up. 
Hmmmm, I hope my next call I make the persons day and they are on cloud 9, not angrily hanging up on me and putting a damper on my day."
It‚Äôs just perfect
a great and amazing helpful app!! so proud people with disabilities get the help they need.
I want to help more.
Lame
awesome app everyone should download
I‚Äôd love to help but it hasn‚Äôt rang yet after 8 days..

"I'd advise everyone to read the Be My Eyes Terms of Service and Privacy Policies you agree to by using this service, before actually participating in this service.

In their Terms of Service that basically state that may share the content of video calls you do with third parties, and that while anonymizing some details about that, that they will not edit the video calls at all. So, some unknown company you don't know, that Be My Eyes is using to help with their service, will get to view a video conference you made with a blind or sighted person. I don't want anybody besides this company, using that information. TOS agreements like this and just legal bull crap and give the company way too much freedom with your personal data.

I know most people never read a company's Terms of Service or Privacy Policy. But, if you want to know more about what I stated or doubt the veracity of my claim, read it yourself. It is linked at the bottom of the page in the App Store for this app.

Also, something else that I found really detestable in their Terms of Service. Is that Be My Eyes states clearly that they will give your personal information, your phone number, email address, to charities or other similar organizations. Basically, Be My Eyes hands out or more likely sells your personal information to telemarketers. Wow, how wonderful... Just because it's a so called charity you're giving our personal information to, well that doesn't make it less annoying when they hound you on your cell or home phone, day and night, trying to get you to give money. 

Plus, look up online the track record of charities that use telemarketing to get donations. Haha, it's not a very ethical track record. I don't want those possible charlatans constantly annoying me with incessant phone calls all day, every day. They usually don't take ""I'm not interested, please take me off your list, thank you"" for an answer.

I was all for wanting to helping the blind or visually impaired by using this application/service. But, it's a shame that their Terms of Service are so messed up and way too broad for my peace of mind. And, again, I'd advise anyone interested in using this app and service to first read the company's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that you both agree to by using this app/service. 

I give two stars on the merit of this seemingly good idea. But really I would give only the default one star just going off of the shady policies you have to agree to here. Update those to make them less invasive and shady and I'll be happy to help out with by using this app."
Revolutionary
amazing asset for the visually impaired and non visually impaired.

"This app is a great example of the power of technology to actually improve the lives of anyone. This app focuses on blind or sight challenged folks in a clever way. I am not blind but it's just as important to me because it engaged me and makes me feel like part of a community every time I help out a blind person in need. Every interaction I've had on the app so far has been positive and I believe I was able to help the person on the other end. My only complaint is that I do not get enough notifications to help out but that's because there are already so many others ready to help which is a great thing. Next time you spend 20 minutes reading through a pointless Twitter storm rant or waste half a day on Facebook, remember that apps like this are the reason tech enthusiasts are so passionate about tech. I would love to see this concept expanded out to help anyone with needs.

BTW, my latest Be My Eyes call was some blind dude trying to pick out the best shirt to wear for an interview. I could help him by describing the shirts to him but then he started asking me for help on an entire matching outfit so I took the phone to my wife who helped me help him. Point is, we all need help from each other from time to time."
"As a sighted person who worked for many years for a visually impaired person, I was thrilled when I learned of this app's existence. I immediately read up on it and then signed up. That was a few weeks ago, and I've since had the privilege of helping two users. While the connection has been a bit spotty on my two calls, it certainly didn't prevent us from getting the task at hand successfully completed. And to address another of the whiners' complaints, yes, you may indeed go for a couple or more weeks without getting a call. Here's the thing: that is not a problem. For heaven's sake, think this through. Isn't it a wonderful thing that there are so many potential helpers?!  Be My Eyes is a marvel and a godsend to those who need it. And it also has the happy bonus of being a way for those of us who like to help people to do so, easily and instantly and completely at our convenience. It's almost embarrassing how easy and convenient it is. So thank you, app creators. You've made the world a much better place for all of us, visually impaired and sighted alike."
"3/5 Stars While the idea is great the user interface and features aren‚Äôt the best.
-First, Once I created my account I wasn‚Äôt even sure if the app worked. Does the app have to be open to receive a call or does it run in the background. I was under the impression that I want running in the background because the little triangle in the upper right hand, the one that tells you an app was recently using your location, was not present. So that one problem that I saw with the app, I wasn‚Äôt sure if the app was working properly. 
-Second, there seems to be a lot of ‚Äútrolls‚Äù on the internet and Im concerned that they could be misguiding the blind by giving them wrong information. I think there needs to be a way to separate those who genuinely help and those who are trying to pull a prank, I think there should be a rating system of some sort where users can have a rating or something so the ‚Äúmost helpful‚Äù stand out. 
-Third, is there  a way of turning the service off? I would love for the app to be running in the background so I may be of assistance to the blind in need but I think there should be a way to pause or temporarily shut off the service, like at night when your trying to get sleep. But over all, great idea and concept, just some issues that I‚Äôm sure will be fixed in future updates."
"this great app actually works!!! For those who need sight assistance and those willing to visually assist!!!

It works so well that I started thinking that The Developer should create a Language Companion version for people on vacation or otherwise learning on the spot (not studying) who happen to be in another country, especially in countries whose language doesn't use Latin characters (English, Spanish, etc) that someone could atleast attempt to sound out the word. Imagine someone in an Eastern European country or in North Africa or North Asia? Completely different character base of writing, and no way to guess the word or phrase and forget the online translators, you could insert a phrase in English asking for a zoo and the translator could just as easily translate to asking for a live butcher market. (or worse, some form of insult or even criminal intent). 

Also, rstone is ok for some people who are receptive to learning in the way they use, but as a native speaker of 5 languages, I can say that if created, this type of app would be like having a native speaker of not just the language, but even of the country or local dialect in a country region (or a bunch of people along with someone on vacation or has moved to another country for work or other necessity).
Developer, Feel free to contact me, I'd love to help in this regard. 
Again, Great App !!! Cheers!!!"
"I signed up 8 or 9 months ago as a way to try and help make a difference in someone's life even if it's a small one like picking the right food up at the grocery store. I wish I could tell you how great this app is and how fulfilled I feel after helping someone but sadly I cannot. There is no way to email or report issues or bugs so now I'm left writing a bad review after another unsuccessful connection. The app never works, it crashes on almost every call. I've tried connecting to 9 people in 9 months and only 1 of those was what the blind would call successful. It was a poor connection and very grainy, it was very difficult to hear exactly what was being asked. But being the 1st time I figured it could only get better from there, but sadly I was mistaken. I have this love hate relationship with this app where every time it goes off I get a smile on my face knowing someone needs my help only to be disappointed time and time again when it doesn't work properly. The other reviews are clearly from people that work on the app and not actual users like I am otherwise you would hear more of the same. This app needs a lot of work and at best is only worth 1 star."
"I see a lot of reviews from people saying that they haven't gotten any calls. My mother has been completely blind her entire life and she knows better than anyone that technology for the visually impaired is years behind what it should be. I'm predicting it will take the blind community time to even become aware that this app exists. What I can say for sure is that my mom is extremely grateful for an app like this. She actually has facetimed me in the past to ask me what color shirt would look best with her outfit, or to have me read a soup can label, and so on. Blind people NEED apps like this, and you don't know how much you'll be helping by downloading this app. It only takes a minute out of your day to make a huge difference in someone's life. So, I encourage you to keep the app if you can spare the storage space instead of getting discouraged and deleting it."
I gave this app a four star rating. I did this because it would've had five stars if the app would have better connectivity when it comes to a cited part or I said helper. The app wait forever before finally connecting you to someone to help you. It takes at least 2 to 3 minutes before you get someone but when you do get people there very kind very gracious and they do help. The app has no accessibility issues other than that. They're definitely does need to be a better connectivity system so that is soon as you press that button you got somebody Who is sort of loans their eyes to you for a few minutes and help you with whatever task you need. It very much would help though if it was faster when it comes to connectivity this app would've gotten a five star rating would it have been this way. The only reason for me that it got a four star rating was because of the connectivity problem.
"I'm not a huge reviewer but I just downloaded this and almost five minutes later got my call. It was fast and easy to connect, had no technical issues, and I feel like I actually helped someone. 

Honestly, I am thrilled by this app. I love the idea of helping someone out - even if it's as simple as reading a yarn label or helping pick out a shirt. It's people helping people, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

I do wish there was a way to review people who volunteer to be their eyes, though. I am worried that this technology could be used by bully or trolls to mislead people. I choose to believe that there are more good people than bad though and look forward to my next call. :)"
"Be my eyes is a very useful concept. As one would expect from an app of this nature, it is fully accessible. One complaint I do have, is whenever you make a call, The app makes the iPhone perform some sort of equalization to voiceover. While I'm not a big fan of the iPhone doing that, and I normally wouldn't complain about it, the app doesn't reset whatever sound settings it sets after the call has ended. The only ways that I have found to force the sound to reset itself back to its normal setting, is to either close the app and reopen it, or activate Siri. I'm not sure if this is being caused by iOS, or be my eyes it's self, but I figured I would let people know none the less. The only thing I can say for certain regarding the sound, is that it only happens when you make a call for help."
"App is installed on my phone. If someone who is visually impaired needs help, they initiate the app on their side. It pops up on my phone. If I am able to I answer it, I do. I have helped read directions on food, identify food from a freezer, read icons on a computer screen and a few other simple tasks. Sometimes I talk to the people for a few minutes also, sometimes it is quick and we are done. The people cannot see me and I can only see what they show me. I have never had a problem with audio or camera. We have always had good connections. I like meeting people from different places and being helpful when I can. It's a great app!"
"This is a great app especially when I go away for work and I'm staying in hotels. It's wonderful to just be able to connect to be my eyes and get someone to help me find the apple juice or help me change the air conditioner or heater in the room. It's nice to be able to do things without always having to ask someone else for help or find someone to ask for help. I really appreciate it and it's great to show clients as well. I am a vision rehabilitation therapist and I show this app to clients all the time. The volunteers are very patient and very nice. I really appreciate their effort and time.
My only complaint would be that it takes a lot of time at times to connect to a volunteer. If this issue could be fixed this would be even better."
"While I have found this program to be very helpful in the past regarding identifying things around the house, perhaps this morning was my most useful experience. At work I had to select an avatar for some work-related business. I could not select it with the keyboard, and my screen reader would not describe anything about the avatars available. The helper was able to describe the avatars and then help me use my touchpad to select and activate the avatar I needed. Thanks for this great service! This is a wonderful concept that has been put into action in a very successful way."
"What a brilliant idea. This app works very well and leaves me feeling good after every use (I'm a sighted helper), knowing I at least tried to help (it doesn't always work out quite as one might hope, but that's not the app's fault). My kudos and thanks to the developers.

Oh ‚Äì I hadn't opened the latest version of the app before I wrote that. I'm disappointed to see that the points system and my stats are gone now. Neither can I any longer attach a photo to my profile (though I suppose if the only people who would encounter it are blind, it is really kind of pointless).

So now my jury is a little more out on the app. I'll have to see how it works in actual use now before I can really say more about it."
"I would love to give this app more stars because it is a great idea and has helped people already. However, the developer makes the same mistake that a lot of folks do when it comes to the visually impaired. In order to use this as a blind person you have to have Voiceover turned on in the Accessibility section. Not all people that qualify as blind are totally blind. There is a good sized population that have some vision that don't use the Voiceover feature. I downloaded the app, thinking it would be great for me when I need help reading something. I tried out the Voiceover feature and did not like it at all. Since I don't like it, I can't use the app. Don't assume all blind people do things in the same way. Let us choose what accessibility features we want to use."
"I heard about this app from Spike, who is a member on a local morning radio show, Mojo In The Morning, here in Detroit. I grew up with a sister who was visually impaired and I can't say I was the nicest to her growing up; but I have seen the difficulties she has endured; After hearing about this app, I downloaded it to see if I could truly help others. As of today, I've helped 2 people with a task and a question; and it gives me a good feeling knowing that I am helping someone get thru their day! I have recommended this app to all my friends and family; in hopes to have even more help for the visually impaired! Awesome app!"
"I just tried Be My Eyes and the connection was fine. Good audio, video worked, the call wasn't dropped. Didn't take very long to find a helper. Would do this again when I'm in need of something more detailed than identifying an object, which TapTapSee is great for. They serve different purposes and I'm happy to have both available to me.

P.S. Was on my DSL connection at home, so the speed/latency was reliable and low, respectively. I don't have a fast connection at all, but judging by what my helper said, the video was good enough to describe things to me."
"I used to have to call friends or family members to help me with the items I couldn't identify with other apps, but Be My Eyes has become my go to app! The time it takes to connect to a person has gotten a lot shorter over the last several months, and the quality of the people offering free assistance has been absolutely wonderful. I have recommended this app to all of my blind friends, and even have a couple sighted friends who signed up to be helpers. Thanks to the developers for coming up with this app, it's very useful, and I appreciate it!"
"This app is so amazing! I am a blind user, and today someone from Holland read me the washing directions for my sweater! This may sound minor, but for someone who is blind and has trouble with small tasks that require vision, it is absolutely unbelievable! Others have given it lower ratings for some minor problems, and I won't deny that they exist. But the app really works, and it is so ingenious that all of those little things, that don't really matter anyway, are completely overshadowed! I could go on and on, and I can't give this a high enough rating! Love love love this app!!!"
"It took a few weeks before I got a call but when I did it was totally worth it. It was from a blind man who had been taken to the emergency room and he wanted someone to describe the scene to him and help him get his bearings and to make sure there were medical personnel around. I can't imagine a scarier thing than being blind in the chaotic mess of an ER. 
This is the most awesome concept and use of technology I can imagine. Please encourage everyone you know to download it. It takes just a little time out of your day and it can mean the world to someone."
"I'm sad to see all the 1 star reviews just because people haven't gotten a request for help yet. I haven't either, but the app seems to be a great start to assisting people that ask for help. The set-up and functions are easy to follow, great that it runs in the background, nice that there is a point reward system. Heard the system functioning perfectly through a segment on Hawaii NPR - had a blind woman ask for help, one woman she connected with was in Australia and the other was in Thailand. I'm excited about this app and excited to help anyone that calls :)"
"I just got to help someone find a couple cans of stewed tomatoes in their pantry! It was very quick, less than 30 seconds between getting the notifications and them having their tomatoes. My day is made! üòä

I've actually had this app for over a year and this is the first time I've gotten to ""be someone's eyes"". I hope that means other people are really quick to help, and not that most blind people who might need help don't know about the app.

This app is a really great idea, and it works! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I downloaded and waited two weeks, with no calls for help. Then I thought, it would probably be much more runner to meet people if I pretended and signed up as a blind person. And I KNOW I'm not the only one thinking that. So there must be a lot of jokers, trolls, etc for example (can you tell me which testicle is my left one?) it seems there should. Be a way to validate if you are truly blind somehow...and again.. No instructions  ... I don't know if I have to have the app open the whole time or what. But sitting around for five or six hours til you get one call? Seems unbalanced. And a lotttt of flaws.. Though I do love the simple interface I just don't know what the heck I'm supposed to be doing"
"This app is amazing. I signed up to help and got my first call a few hours later. I was initially confused because my screen went dark, but then a woman's voice said hello. Her question was whether her bathroom light was on or off. Considering I couldn't see anything, I told her it was off. She thanked me and we hung up. It left me feeling good about myself afterward.

If you're doing this at work, I'd recommend having a headset or your Bluetooth handy, since the calls use speakerphone if you aren't using one."
"Fantastic idea, but there are no instructions on how to actually use this app! I'm trying to be a helper, but I have gotten no calls for help. How do I know if I'm ever going to receive calls for help? Do I need to leave the app open in the foreground at all times? Do I need to relaunch the app every hour? Every day? Every 15 minutes? What if I turn off my phone and then turn it on again? It's very confusing about what I'm actually supposed to do in order to provide help... there are no instructions! Even worse, the app won't be that useful if we are manually required to keep relaunching it all the time or keep it open."
Hi I Love this app. I used it for the first time on Saturday morning. My seeing-eye dog had an allergy flare up on the left side of her left paw.  I got some help from a guy from Australia.  I had a lady helping me sort through my mail from Korea. I love the patience and dedication from the volunteers. The lady told me when I had to make the pages of the mail  clear for her to see them we both had a lot of fun guessing what type of mail I had in my hand. I recommend this app to anyone who is blind or visually impaired!
"I used to help the blind fairly often & really enjoyed doing so...but now there is no way to get the app to open to accept alerts that are defaulting to my Apple Watch.  The call alerts used to be handed off just fine from watch to iPhone on the previous version of Be My Eyes.  I was a ""promising helper"", but no longer can help the blind b/c I can no longer accept calls.  I miss seeing my stats as well.  Why was this taken away?  This was a great idea that no longer works for helpers that have Apple watches.  Many potential helpers excluded now...isn't that defeating your purpose?  Please go back to the old interface, version and functionality that worked just fine.  Another instance of ""Don't fix what is not broken"".  üòì"
"Excellent app. I feel it is one or two small adjustments away from greatness. The UI for sighted people can be a bit confusing and the points system seems slightly odd but I understand it is there not as a game but to rate users. The hardest part is the fact that I have answered a bunch of calls but usually am beaten to it by someone else who helps faster than me. This is a great problem to have, but can be a bit frustrating. Overall though this app is excellent."
"Hi. So here is the deal. I have had this app for about 2 days now and I have not gotten any calls. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love the idea behind it. And it still astonishes me that someone came up with this. And I know that people are being helped because every time I open the app it says more people have been helped. Please let me know if I have to do something in the settings or something. Any answers will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you,
Nick magnani"
I downloaded the app (fri it's now the Thursday after) thinking what a great idea but I have to get a call. I gave it three stars because nothing was really happening and I have questions that seem to go unanswered. I can see ppl r being helped and that's great but why have someone sign up and not use their help? Is there a way of knowing if ur available to help someone? Is there more a person has to do in order to help someone? Until some of the questions r answered I don't see me using this app which would b a shame because I think the concept behind it is brilliant!!
"This is such a great concept. There aren't many apps I can say I am proud of downloading, but this is definitely the top one. I've helped multiple people since downloading this app and each time I'm grateful to have this app so that they can get immediate attention. I'm very pleased that there is now an easier way to aid someone directly when they ask for it. Highly recommend this to anyone who can give a couple minutes of their day to a stranger."
"It made my day when I got my first call. However I've missed several since because the ring tone needs to be louder and much longer. By the time I picked up my phone which was right beside me and tried to answer the call was gone. 
 The last one I missed the phone was right in my hand and it says swipe to answer but swiping didn't work? Can you fix this? 
 I love this app so that I can be of help to others."
"I've been using the app for about 4 months now and have been able to help 4 people. They were very small tasks that didn't require much effort on my part. But these small things can reduce so much frustration for blind folks and, since they know you've volunteered, there's no sense of inconvenience involved. I always feel great after completing an interaction. What an incredible tool to the non-sighted increase their autonomy!"
Hello - this app is about helping people. Giving a poor review because you have not gotten a call is crazy! Really? Or a poor review because the app wants information on you and your smart phone. Really?? Having a disability makes you a little more concerned about your safety. Hopefully the app is using the info to weed out the crazies! Sign up because you want to help NOT because you want to brag to your friends.
"I've had this app for a couple of weeks now, and I just received my first call. It was awesome! I work with a blind person, so this seemed like a great way to help. It's not hard, and there isn't an issue with privacy. The other person just asks a question and you answer to the best of your ability. Other have complained about the video, but mine worked perfectly. Thank you for this app!"
"I was very impressed with the directions my helper gave me especially since English was not her first language and she was not very familiar with English cursive. We had some confusion with the brand names on my shopping list, but other than that it was great!  The app did not connect immediately but it was well worth the extra minute of waiting. It works as advertised. I am very impressed."
"Had not used the app in quite a while because of lengthy wait times. After recent updates, decided to try again when I needed help reading labels.  The request was answered in about 30 seconds; the person reading was friendly and read what I needed quickly and efficiently. The app works great, and I certainly plan on using it often now the wait time is so short.

"I haven't used this app very often, but when I've needed it, I was sure glad it was there. From checking the expiration date on a carton of milk, to reading directions on cold medicine, to helping me read a computer screen to get past a snag in upgrading to a newer version of Windows, this app and those fantastic people on the other end really can make a difference. Thanks everyone."
"I've had this app on my phone since it was first released and finally got the opportunity to help someone for the first time today. Yes, the calls you will receive as a sighted person are few and far between, BUT that should be a good thing! It means that there are many people being assisted and even more people that want to help! Love this app and the feeling you get with it. Thank you!"
"I've been able to help some people a few times in the past and doing this is a great feeling. However in the last 3 times, curiously all 3 in the last 10 days, the call/connection lasted only a few seconds and then the calls dropped. I only got to say hi but unfortunately I couldn't give any help. My only guess is that the connection to Internet is poor or that the app is having trouble maintaining the call. Overall I think this is a great tool to give some little help to blind people."
"It doesn't seem appropriate to give the app a bad rating because volunteers aren't getting calls. As of this writing, there are 24,000 blind users and over 300,000 volunteers: 12.5 times MORE volunteers than blind users. that's a wonderful thing. So be patient. It would be a shame if end users who could really benefit from this app are scared off by all the 1 stars that aren't really applicable to their experience."
"I love the idea and inspiration behind this app. I haven't received a call yet but after watching the tutorial it explains that if you don't want to be called during a certain time, all you need to do is log out. If you're logged into the app you will be open to receiving calls. It hasn't crashed for me yet as a lot of readers have stated so fingers crossed the bugs have been fixed."
"I just helped someone in Australia fix their CPAP machine. I'm in the US. It was the first use of the app for both of us. 
The video worked well and I was able to help him read what was on his machines screen. You get a good feeling from helping someone with a task the sighted world takes for granted.
Edit: After missing a few phone calls, it might be best if the developers added more time to answer."
"Everyone remember the point of this app is to help people who can't see.. it's not about the poor connection or if people are rude sometimes (people have bad days), it's about helping someone that's legally blind. I've only help 4 people in about 2 or 3 years but that's okay because it's not about me, it's about the people I help. Everyone should download this app! It's amazing and everyone has been so nice!"
I just installed and used this app for the first time because I needed help identifying some money. The sighted volunteer was really  nice and helpful! The audio video connection works so much better than sending a picture because the sighted person can help me find the camera! I love this app and will definitely use it again when the need arises!
"I must say I discovered this app last week and was immediately excited about installing and a chance to give back by directly helping somebody. Unfortunately I have not been asked yet, hopefully soon at least so I know that my account is good to go... I'll be standing by. Once I have been able to successfully help someone I will be convinced this app is legit and upgrade my review to five stars as the concept truly is priceless! üòéüëçüëç"
"App doesn't open. Every time I am alerted ""someone needs your help"" when I go to open it, it says someone else has already answered and thanks anyway. I was told by the app's support to make sure I updated. I updated and same thing. I then thought perhaps I wasn't answering fast enough. I now have been alerted at least 10 times, never being able to answer. Some of those times, I opened the app after only 1 ring. The longest time it rang before I opened out of those 10 occurrences was 4 rings. What a tease. I submitted a support ticket multiple times. It doesn't work. I finally just got rid of it."
I just signed up for the app and I am very happy to help. I would like to make a suggestion. Is there a way to set time restrictions on when you can help a caller (let's say I'm available or not available from 8am-8pm on Saturday) or do you just have to sign out and sign back in every time you are available? Is there a setting to indicate what language you speak? I look forward to the first call where I can help an individual.
I thought this would be great to help the blind but it doesn't work properly. First I signed up to help but only got a call once and it didn't connect me. You almost never get a call as a helper because this app lies to you! When you look at the amount of helpers it will give you something like this: 179.... What that really means is there are 179 thousand helpers. I know this because I also signed up as a blind person and saw the truth there. Worst part is I made a call for help it never connected me to anybody. This app is a disgrace and should be deleted because their updates haven't fixed anything.
"I really wanted to use this, and it sounded like a great way to easily help other people, but I read the privacy policy. It sounds like basically they can gather all information from your smartphone about what websites you visit, what apps you use, and so on, and sell and use that to target marketing and ads to you. This is a major concern, and makes it seem like maybe that is the main purpose of this, especially given a lot of the reviews saying they have not received any requests from help from any blind people."
"The call came in and it was an senior woman that wanted to label some cans of veggies, soup, and fruit.  We had a nice session that lasted about 15 minutes.  She was thankful to have a way to identify her cans and I was great full for the opportunity to help make someone's day easier.  A true win-win.

Thank you Be My Eyes for facilitating this opportunity to employ cooperation to improve the world."
"I love the premise of this app. The execution is not great at all. First off it drops my profile photo every week, not sure why there's a profile pic anyway because blind people. 

I recently helped a blind guy that told me that there are days when there is nobody available to help. I find this odd as I am almost always available but have only been contacted a few times. 

There should also be a trusted helper list where the most helpful people are placed ahead of newbies."
This is a great app. This one is much better than the apps that have you take a picture. I find it helpful to have one on one interaction I hope in future updates you allow us to rate experiences with the volunteers. Also I would like to see this be the beginning of an app that's around for a long time. Thank you for this app
"I've had the app for quite awhile now and love when I get a notification that someone needs assistance. While there aren't a lot of requests for assistance, knowing that I can help at least one person is better than nothing. I wish more individuals with a sight impairment knew about this awesome resource."
"App still does not work. Had it 2 weeks now. Registered via Facebook. Posted a comment on their facebook page and they commented back they were having server problems and an explosion of individuals registering to help to try back in a few days. Still haven't worked. Great concept, but not working."
"The app lacks several features that I feel like an app like this should have. The app should have a ""no-call"" time for when you're sleeping or otherwise don't want to receive the notification, and a status bar to see if the app is even working. I had the app for 3 days and didn't have any calls, nor could I tell if the app was working at all. I really wanted to like this app, it seems like a great idea."
"because I've never been given the chance to help anyone. Wondered if there are some people benefiting from it?Downloaded over a month ago but maybe it's a good thing I haven't been needed. Will keep the app a few more months and if I'm still not contacted, I'll erase it as I know they were looking for some other demographic. Neat concept though."
"Great concept. You don't get called often (I didn't get my first call until three weeks after I installed it). When I did, I was away from home on T-Mobile LTE network. It worked perfect. The video quality was really good. I was able to help someone identify the sender of a package he received in the mail."
"There is no need to even give feedback to this app. Be a good person, help someone in need out, and make this life a better one for all of us. Even if you get one connection in weeks, that one time could mean a lot more to someone in need."
"Downloaded the app 2 weeks ago and I haven't gotten a call. I love the purpose of the app but it needs to let people know what step to take next to get a call and if they are even in a setting where they can receive a call at all. Does the app need to be open or just downloaded to get a call? Do I have to have done all the prompts (watch the video, create profile etc because I've done those already).

This app is so BASIC, which is awesome but leads me to wonder why the hell the kinks haven't been worked out!

Frickin frustrating."
"It's a simple thought‚Ä¶ If you don't have this app you're WRONG! I just successfully completed my second help call to help a young man get a glass of water. This is so easy, so meaningful, and so empowering. There is no reason for every sighted person not to have this app on their device and ready."
This app is great for any blind person who needs access to a pair of eyes at any given time when they don't have a loved one available and also great for anybody who can see and wants to offer assistance to a blind person in their spare time. This is an awesome use of today's modern mobile technology.
"While the app is a great idea and I'm sure it has helped a number of people, it's practically useless to the sighted person who wants to help. I've had the app for more than four months and only once has the app alerted me that someone needed help. I answered immediately, but someone else had taken the call first. With 333,000 sighted people and only 25,000 blind using the app, the chances of actually getting to help someone are very slim. Instead, it simply takes up space on my phone."
"Try it and wrate it please guys and girls.
As I previously said, it's a wonderful app which offers a great service.
My only reason to give it 4 of 5 stars because when you sometimes ask for help nobody is there to get your help and except it,  and this is because it depends on the time and on the availability 
But when she, or he answers, there are so cool and helpful and so nice to meet.
For the call quality, it is clear with no latency at all, this is on my humble opinion.
Thank you so much, and I know I'm asking for so much but, we hope in the future you're going to make it like a 24 hour service.

Kind regards"
I saw this app on a news story and knew that it was something I would love to do.  The thought of helping someone just by answering my phone seemed great.  I have been a part of Be My Eyes for a few years and have been able to help people in my my small way.  Definitely worth the download.
"We all take out sight for granted. Little things matter in quality of life - something as simple as knowing what is right in front of you. With this app, you're able to help people see the world around them. Great app, easy to use and helps to make a small positive difference."
"Thankfully, I'm not one who needs an app like this but I HAD to download it just so I could write a review. Apps like this are incredible! Thank you developers for creating such a unique and helpful app and also making it completely free!! You guys are great and I hope to see more apps like this in the future!!"
"I'm blind, and I haven't used this very often, but when I do, it's a lifesaver. A few years ago, when I was really in need of a drink, someone help me with figuring out what button on the soda machine to press. Today I tried it out again, when I received my new Wi-Fi router, and a really nice lady help me get it working."
"I needed to change the setting of a thermostat, and turn it from AC to heat. This app connected me to a very kind and helpful woman, who helped me to do so. Thank you to everyone Who has signed in. Even if you never received a call, the fact that you are willing means a great deal."
My son is visually impaired This app gives me great hope for help and options when he lives on his own Please be patient it takes time for word to spread in the blind community of new tools like this. You could help a tremendous amount of people. Please don't give up. Thank you for volunteering
I downloaded The app to help people that can't see. I've gotten two calls within the past two months that I have downloaded the app and both of the calls have not gone through. As soon as I try to answer that call the app shuts down. I think this is such a cool idea and I would love to be able to help someone but it doesn't seem to be working so I don't know if I keep the app on my phone much longer.
"This is an excellent app and has helped me out many times. I have spoken to people from countries all over the world who have helped me see needed things especially in a pinch. You might occasionally have to wait a bit for a cited helper, but it's always worth the effort."
"I am completely blind and I know there are times when I'm alone and I am sometimes needing help with whatever I'm doing or trying to do!! I haven't used the app for help yet, but I'm sure it will be beneficial and I'm so happy more apps like this are coming out to help us!! :)"
"I have only received two assist calls. Both calls failed. First on connected two helpers. She stated I called her and she accepted the call. But I received a notice for assistance. Second one connected he asked for help with expiration date on a milk bottle but then the screen went black. I could hear him but had no image. 
The app has bugs. But I'll keep it to help when I can."
"I just received my first call. I was amazed at how quickly the call connected and how clear everything was. It was totally anonymous so I don't know who I helped, but it was a nice feeling to know I helped make her day a little easier."
"The concept couldn't be better!! I just helped my first person today but the video quality was so poor that I couldn't read what He showed me in the Facetime-esque screen. I had a blazing fast Internet connection too. Instead, there should be a more simplified option to send an HD snapshot image so the quality can be maximized due to bad internet."
"Today was the 3-4th time I have been able to assist the visually impaired. A man showed me a picture of a woman he is planning to take on a date. He only wanted to know if she had all of her teeth. I said not only that but she is absolutely beautiful! 
All the world needs is more love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This application has been extremely helpful to me‚Ä¶ I have been able to do such things as read instructions on baking items, to resolving my computer problems when I had no speech‚Ä¶"
"I just finished helping my first person :) what a great app. He needed to know what color shirt he was wearing, and I was glad to help. We then talked for another 10 minutes about each other's days, it was refreshing. Love this app, highly recommend!"
"i've only use this app a few times, but every time I have used it, I've had an outstanding experience. The volunteers are fantastic, and all have accomplished the goals I needed assistance with. Highly recommend this app!"
"I like the concept this app is trying to portray to help others. I joined in the hopes to help those people. However, the ratio of sighted to blind individuals is easily 12:1. And there's no guarantee you'll be able to help someone. You just carry on your way until there's the slim chance you get an alert."
This app is amazing. It makes me feel good that I am able to help someone else. I have been the eyes for several people. Share this app with others! It doesn't cost a dime to help someone out! Pay it forward! Be kind to one another!
"As a sighted helper it was easy to set up.

My blind friend Albert signed up but there is no option to choose a helper by rating or to set someone as their favorite so to call the same person again is impossible. Every call is to a random person.

It would be better to have a fav list and join up with the same persons or group of persons that we are familiar with from a previous call help building trust. 

Also need a personality profile for who you are talking to. Maybe a sound byte to hear their voice or choose a man or woman or age of helper or location to help with local needs."
"I've had the opportunity to help 2 blind people so far, and it feels so good to know that something as simple as helping out in this little way can have such a great impact on those needing assistance.  The person I helped was very appreciative for Be My Eyes.  Life is beautiful."
"Have had two calls in three months and both have failed. Both times I was connected to reliable wifi (different locations) and connected for around 10 seconds before connection was lost. I hope this is fixed soon, this is such a wonderful idea!!"
"I got my 1 call today. I feel so honored and excited to be given this great opportunity to help someone. I've had a few misses here and there. I'm just really glad I finally got to help. 
I look forward to helping more people. Great idea for an appüëçüèº."
Hey can take a while sometimes to get a helper but it's amazing that so many people have signed up to help and it's really invaluable when a person needs some eyeballs and you're able to get it from your phone
I signed up and less than 1 hr I received a call. I haven't had a problem from this app. I really love that the developer has made this app free. There are a lot of people out there who could really benefit from using this app
"Awesome idea and I love that it's free to assist and to request assistance. I wish there was some way to determine if your in queue to help or not. I just leave the app open when I'm not busy, but I can't tell if that's the right thing to do. I hope it is and that I can help soon!"
"Not only has this been an amazing way for people to help others, but it makes you feel good inside that you were able to help people that can't see, and are partially disabled. I have not gotten a single call, but when I do, I know I will be able to help. I love this app!"
"I love the idea behind this app, but I have missed a few calls because I have my phone locked. Can you update the app to where it doesn't ignore the call before I even open my phone to get to the app??"
"When I first used this app a long while back, it was very difficult to connect with people that spoke my language. I started using it recently, and oh my goodness how it has improved. Thank you developers. It is appreciated."
"It is awesome to see people of all ages and from different countries and from all walks of life volunteering to help! I have use this app often and received great help most of the time. Thank you volunteers, you make this world A better place."
"My mom is legally blind (RP runs in our family) and I help her around the house with similar tasks, so I know how frustrating they can be. I'm physically disabled so I am often at home and bored - I think it's great I can help others remotely!"
I just got my first two calls today and missed both because the ringtone sounds like one of my sons toys. I'm bummed cause I would love to help. It would be great if it could give more of a screen notification as well like a normal phone call.
"Just download. You don't have to have the app running to get a call. Log in and wait weeks, years but help someone in need. :) app run by volunteers and it's not perfect YET.  I'll keep just for a chance to help."
"I've had this app for about 3 years. In that time, I've gotten four calls to help, and I've met some very interesting people and learned a lot. I don't get calls very often but when I do it's really nice!"
"This is a really fabulous idea for an app! I would really love to help out, so I downloaded. I've had the app for about a week now, and haven't gotten any calls. Is there something I'm doing wrong with my settings? Maybe there's just a lot of other people to help too :) anyway, awesome app!"
"I love this app. As a mom of 4 young kids, I love that this gives me an opportunity to serve others but still be at home with my kids. It's also a great way for my kids to witness me doing service for someone in need."
"I still haven't had the chance to help anyone yet, but that just means that there's a lot of people able to help which is awesome! I can't wait to help make someone's day better."
"This app is genius:  connecting people who need quick assistance with those who are willing to help.  The few times I have been contacted,  it works flawlessly and it makes my day."
I just helped my first person to make sure she was defrosting the right package of meat for dinner. Clear picture and really easy to do. Got called one other time but I was driving and couldn't help.
"Fantastic idea for an app that serves a real purpose to disadvantaged members of our community. As a sighted individual I get excited every time I receive a notification asking for help, though I have as of yet been unable to establish a visual connection, unfortunately rendering me unable to provide assistance."
"I haven't had any calls yet, and I've had it for about two weeks now. And why isn't there a ""friends"" list, so a blind user can call their friends/favorites, and build trust like that? And there should be a bio page, where we can create voice recordings so they can hear us. I want to give it five stars, but it needs improvement."
"This  is what technology should be used for. The ability to be able to realistically HELP each other is literally at our finger tips, and that's a beautiful step towards humanity."
"This is one of my favorite applications of all time, by far the most useful and enjoyable app ever. It allows us to help blind people all over the world. Thank you Be my eyes app for creating such a great app, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"The new UI is slick and I like it. The only downside is that they got rid of the point system. Now the points themselves are arbitrary, but it was nice to see how many people I've helped and how many times I've tried to help but someone connected first."
I used this today for the first time at work. It was awesome. The gentleman on the other and was able to tell me what kind of granola bar I had and also the calorie count and everything. Woo hoo.
This app is perfect and it helps so many people. If I were undecided this app would be in use all the time. Great work by great people; for great people.
"My first call was awesome! From a man named Jose, and I just had my second call from a gentleman in Japan setting his up for the first time! That call tested my Japanese skills!
It's nice to know I can be of help to people around the world!!!"
Fabulous way to be of service. Only downside is that so many people are helping that I don't get as many calls as I would like. Love this app and love helping folk.
I just requested assistance and the person was very rude. They have me end up on the floor searching for a remote controller for my television that was really on the counter. They were rude and called me very nasty things. It also took 15 minutes for me to connect with them. It then took me another 15 minutes to connect with someone who told me where the controller really was.
Amazing idea but it keeps crashing every time. I deleted and installed it again and still crashes every time
I have worked with blind people who find this app to be so helpful in enabling their independence. It's an elegant use of technology to have many people easily solve real problems with technology.
This is an absolutely marvelous application for anyone who is blind I truly believe it is a must-have and I am anxiously awaiting a new version with even more features thank you so much to the developer
"This app is very helpful to those who are fully blind, however I am colourblind and the option keeps telling me to turn on voiceover which I don't need. I think i'm better off just asking a friend what colour something is :))"
I downloaded the app literally a few hours ago and was able to do my first call! It was super fun and the person was super thankful trying to find her toothbrush!
"I am a teacher for the blind and instruct my students how to use their iPads and iPhones. They use the accessibility feature of the device, which talks and tells them everything."
Fantastic Ap!  Just started using this and did not have to wait long.  Such a stress reliever that I can quickly find out what I have in front of me!
"Whoever made this is some of the sweetest people there is. We need more people using technology like this for the good of the people! Il be helping any minute I can, as should all of you. This is great. 5 stars"
This is a great app but you may need to make the language not set to English as default. Please make the language option preference set from the registration screen for both users. Thanks
I really like the idea of this app. I feel like it can get far with a few bug fixes üëå. I haven't helped anyone out yet but i hope i can soon üôàüëÄ
This app is awesome but I wish you could keep the person that you used to be your eyes not just a random every time but overall it's amazing
"I like the app, but for some reason I haven't been notified to help anyone? And I don't have a Facebook or Twitter account, so I can't collect points? What am I suppose to do?"
The app works really well. Sometimes connecting is a bit difficult. The connections are not as stable as one would like.
I just use this app for the first time because my computer wanted to do an automatic update of my antivirus protection but the window would not speak to me so I dialed up be my eyes and was wonderfully talked through it by a very helpful guy only a state away from where I live. What a relief
It's great I make an account an everything but wen the app really starts it close and I can't use it I erase it and install it again and still not work!!!
"Wow... left me speechless strait down to my heart. I love the fact that they're still kind-hearted people left in the world to help the blind to see. This app is amazing, so my way of saying that was to leave it with 5 stars."
"As a blind user, receiving help when needed, whether it be a trivial or important topic, I thank the BME team for lending us a helping hand. The connection time has improved and the app works Great with an iPhone 6S."
"Got my first request today to help someone ""see"" something,
worked great! My son is blind, so I know the frustrations he has had. So nice to be able to help someone else!"
"I have waited for 5 months and I still haven't gotten single call. I can't help the blind if no one CALLS! I think too many people found out about this program so it is very rare to get a call. 

I've concluded that I should just get rid of the app. So... cya!"
"If I could give this no stars I would. I loved the concept and was ready to start helping people, but I've had this app for awhile now I haven't gotten one call. I started to read the policy and notice this a s heme to access your phone information and send to other people. I'm going to keep for little while longer to see if I get a call, but if I don't I'm deleting it."
I really don't write reviews but if they could do more apps like this for less fortunate people it would be amazing.. It is a good way to help people in need for everyday things
"Three weeks in and still no calls, you get three stars for the idea, but I'm deleting it, if you're blind you should download this, but otherwise there's no need, there's like a 1:65 ratio of blind to sighted respectively, so I don't suggest downloading if you are only looking to help."
"App repeatedly tells me to check for an Internet connection. It won't allow me to login, it won't send password recovery, it won't work."
This app should have been here a long time a go this app is very helpful I am so happy to have this app right now I have benefited from this app as a blind person
"I have this app for more than 3 months but I never get any calls at all, I am very willing to help!

It's better if we can choose a music for easy notification and not the boring tone when getting a call just like the Test Call. I'm not sure if I need to have this app for a longer time or have it deleted? ü§î"
"Now that there are so many seeing users, I don't get to help as often, but that tells me that many more people are helping, which is inspiring."
"This seems like a wonderful concept, but unfortunately I've not been able to experience it, despite my having downloaded it months ago, because I haven't received one call yet."
I've helped 2 people in the past week and they were both great experiences on both ends of the calls! What a wonderful idea!!
"Wow it is truly an amazing app that can make me help others. There are multiple languages so if you know more than one language, PLZ select them and help more people!"
"It's a great feeling to be able to help someone so much and with such ease.  Frankly, I hope to receive many more requests for assistance."
"This app requires that you have voice over turned on if you are blind or be a volunteer if you are sighted and no in between. I am simply Visually Impaired: I can't read print but I still drive. I just was hoping to get some assistance with things I can't see, but unfortunately they are discriminatory."
I just received my first call after being signed up for 4 months.  It felt good to help someone so easily.
This app provides a wonderful opportunity to connect the sighted with the sight-impaired. It has worked every time I have received a call.
The only problem so far was I got a call from some kids who were sighted and abusing the system. But otherwise it's great!
Helping each other. We all have our strengths and our need for some help. App works flawlessly.
This app is very inspiring and the developers should be commended for coming up with this idea. That's being said I have only ever received two calls both of which failed. Oh well hopefully others are having better luck.
"I have had two successful calls where I helped blind people.  Since then I have received nothing but fake calls.  I reported these to the developers who claimed to have found the issue, and now I continue to get more fake calls, albeit of a different kind.

I‚Äôll give it another week or so before I decide to delete this app."
Each and every time I have a chance to help is just great. For me. I am hoping that is what the recipient feels. Being someone's eyes is incredible!!
Very helpful application! I was able to read buttons on a washer that I had never used before. I Love this app! Reallygreat work thank you so much.
I've had this app for 2 weeks now and only helped 1 person!! Kinda wish I could help more people!! And I can't add a profile picture for some reason.
Why would you not want to take a few seconds of your time and help someone out.
Apps like this make me believe in humanity. Such a beautiful use of technology. I've help quite a few persons now and it feels great every time.
"I got a call from a young man needing a tag size read from his pants 
And his shirt color 
A very legitimate question 
App worked great I was glad to help"
Brilliant idea and glad to be part of it! The servers have some lag connecting helper to requestor but assume that will improve later. Thanks
"How do the blind find this app? How do they use it? If they have it downloaded someone had to help them, so why doesn't that person just help in the first place. I get that you (developers) wanted to help people, but it likely isn't useful."
"Well, I've been a ""promising helper"" for over 3 weeks now. I just got my first ""help request"" which turned out to be another helper, so this app definitely needs some corrections. Still waiting to actually help someone in need. Maybe you should have an application process, helpers have to meet a certain standard."
I am so glad to have this app! I notice that I sometimes don't get help unless I disconnect and reconnect so that is a bother. Those who help have been very friendly and helpful!
Come up with another use of the app! Or figure out a way for us to help other people in some way too because it's been like 3 weeks and I've never received a call! It makes me wonder wether or not other reviewers have a point with this being primarily an information gathering app for ads?
"Occasionally takes a while to"" connect to a helper, but great when it works!"
Downloaded about a month ago and still haven't received a call. Would really love to help someone!
"This is a great app. I hope that visually impaired people find this useful. If not, then they should give feedback in order to improve the app."
Isn't that good? That means a blind person in distress has not needed your help.
"Good concept, but terrible app. They clearly got too popular and couldn't scale. The interface is terrible and leaves users confused when they can't do anything. The stats don't update unless I quit the app. I can't update my picture. The privacy policy is extremely creepy, so I'm deleting the app. It's unfortunate that this couldn't be used for good."
"I try to answer requests but keep running into this problem- it says ""tap to answer"", but first I must unlock my cellphone. By the time I do (one-two seconds), the call is gone."
"I love helping people, and this app lets me do it in such an amazing way... God bless whoever came up with this app... Brings a smile to my face knowing I can help in the littlest way"
"Great concept, but until they get the bugs worked out, I think that either Skype or Face time would work just as good. I am liking the idea and will wait for the improvements."
This is one great improvement made to many people's lives!
"I was using the app for couple months. Then for some reason I can't log in anymore. I have tried contacting you before via email, but never got any response. Please help me reset the password to my account since obviously something is wrong with it as it won't let me reset it or log in!"
Great idea and concept of the app but the issue is I got an alert call saying someone needed my help and it was a person who can see asking me if I needed any help. So it was a bit of confusion.
I love being able to help the blind and visually impaired through Delta Gamma and this furthers our mission.
Both the good side is were helping blind people bad side I've been signed up for 5 months and no calls
It is a good app it just in case people need help with seeing stuff I hope you and prove the versions even more
"This is really a fabulous resource for almost any kind of help:  identifying stains in clothing, flavors of soup, sorting junk mail by the return address, and more."
"I downloaded the app a few days ago. I haven't received any notifications or calls. 
I don't think I'm signed in Cuz asks me to sign up. But when I try to sign up again it just says the email already exists. But still has no SIGN IN option. 
This app has been horrible. 
Great idea. 
Big tease if you ask me"
"I have had this app for over 2 months, and even though I would be happy to help, never got a call. Love this concept, just wish it actually worked."
The most awesome app. You feel content and happy to be able to help those in need. Don't hesitate and download it now.
"I signed up to help almost 4 weeks ago and have not gotten a single request for assistance from anyone yet.  

As far as the profile photo:  bug to fix...allow person to delete their own photo or change it as opposed to having to contact you to get it done."
Video quality can be bad at times but overall a very good and useful concept thank you
"It took about a month before I started receiving calls, now they come almost daily, sometimes multiple per day. However... It never seems to work, it connects, I see a black screen and then it disconnects, EVERY SINGLE TIME"
Easy way to help out someone. I encourage you to sign up.  The app works with no problems
I get so excited when I receive a call from someone needing assistance. It brightens my whole week!!!
Blind people can't call you because THEY CANT SEE BECAUSE THEY ARE BLIND JUST SAYING... Also why would they have an aid to help them call random people on the Internet if the aid was there JUST SAYING X2 REKT FEDORA NERDS
"Solid concept, but add a toggle for on duty/off Duty. Don't make us log in and out each time.

Make it as easy as possible on the volunteers, right?"
When I tap the app it opens for one second and then it crashes instantly! Please fix it. IOS 10.1 iphone 7
Trying to register as a sighted volunteer through email but whenever I hit register button it throws unable to find active internet connection please check the issue
"Just installed the app and 10 minutes later got a call from a teenage boy, clearly someone else in the room, asking ""which one is the TV?"" with arrogant chuckles in the background.  NOT blind. Rude kid. The creators of the app clearly need to do some sort of screening to regulate ""blind users"". Great idea, too easily abides by idiots."
"This app proves to be helpful for some situations! However, I uninstalled it due to safety concerns. There is no confirmation before connecting to a helper, making it too easy to accidentally connect. That makes me feel really uncomfortable, so I'll stick with Using VizWiz."
Fantastic idea for an app. I rarely get calls but when I do I feel like I directly helped someone. Good app if you have some spare storage space.
had this app installed nearly a year. only was someone's eyes 1 time and one time got another request but it failed connecting. i guess they already have an overflowing number of eyes available so they don't need me. such a good idea but I don't believe it's working. deleting.
I think it has been 2weeks since I downloaded this app and I haven't had any calls yet :( so sad that this great idea can be so frustrating for me sometimes.. Its like i downloaded something just for show.. Really wanted to help!
I would definitely encourage all blind/visually impaired people to obtain this as soon as they hear about it.
Great idea! Some issues with the install and set up but it's working now. Just waiting for the first call!!
"Initially it worked, but with a very long wait time. It took about 4 minutes to connect to someone. Since then, it has crashed consistently (iPhone 6 on iOS 8.1). Hopefully an update will fix that."
But haven't gotten one call yet and had it for two days ... Also says 0 sighted 0 helped.. Would give five stars if I didn't feel like I downloaded it for nothing
Haven't yet helped anyone but did find bugs during setup. Would be happy to offer feedback directly to developer.
This represents the best of humanity. Kudos to whomever built this app. It's gratifying to be able to help somebody in a simple but meaningful way.
I've been a member of this site for about 2-3 months now and I have not helped anyone.  I haven't shared this on Facebook and Twitter. I wonder if they just want you to share their site to get likes and attention.  It's sad because I really thought I was going to help people.
I just answered my first call and I was able to read a telephone number for a person
"I've connected to 4 blind users now but only 1 successfully. And that one connection was super confusing.
Then the app forgot my login credentials and I stopped bothering with it.
Hope it actually helps *someone*"
"As soon as I downloaded this app and opened it, all my contacts were deleted. I have all the numbers, but no names to them, so I don't know who most of them are. I deleted the app and tried numerous other ways to get them back but nothing is working. Help!"
"I love this app. Has really changed my life for the better. I am blind, and I give this a big thumbs up!"
"I hope this works, its such a brilliant concept, proud to be a part of it :)"
Every time I have needed help except for 2 times theother person hung up on me
Yay! Finally got a notification and was able to help a wonderful lady prepare dinner... Hope to help many moreüòò
"In the options to send to Facebook and twitter and watch a video, there's also an option of a test call.. It says to click the home button and wait for a notification but I never get one.. Is this preventing my activation to get real phone calls??"
"Excellent idea and love the intent to help blind and visually impaired. 

I was getting calls at 3 and 4 am!!!!  Sadly had to delete the app because of this. 

The app really needs a way to restrict calls, either by time zone or manual parameters by the user."
This is a simple and fantastic way to help others.
I have had this app a few weeks now and I got the app in hopes I would get to help people and all I wanted to say is that I was disappointed that I wasn't able to help.
I'm blind and i received help reading my thermostat and sorting my laundry.  Very easy! Easier than writing this app review.
"I've never experienced any technical issues, and it feels great to help people!"
"I hope to see many more ""non-profit"" apps like this that help people."
The app it's self is a great concept but how to functions isnt. You don't get calls if you were one of the first people to get it & you can't log in to an existing account. Love the concept just hate how it works #deleted
I am a little skeptical about the app. I think it's a wonderful concept to get volunteers to help but if the person is blind how do they use an iPhone or app on the first place?
Registered and everything but whenever I try to access the app it goes back go my home screen..!
"When you're about to finish the registration either Facebook or with your email the app crashes and closes, you can not open it, I deleted and tried again the same problem, iOS 8.1.2 iphone 6"
"I never was called to help a blind person. What I did get is an endless supply of junk mail in my inbox, they must have sold my email address because I never give it out....I thought this was a worthy cause.  I feel I got scammed."
I've been signed up for a long time now and haven't been able to help anyone. but in the comments I see that a few people aren't receiving help. that's a problem.
I signed up last week and got my first help call today. Awesome app!
Beautiful concept with excellent execution. Very excited to watch this app change the world.
I have had the app for 3 weeks and I have been very eager to help people but not a single chance to help someone yet. ?!?!?!? Is there something I'm missing? I don't have a Twitter so I can't finish the point amount -_- I might delete it soon... I'm not doing any good with it.
There's some bugs and it would be helpful to know if you're live or not.  I installed it earlier today and I haven't received any calls.
It's nice to be able to help the people who cannot see.
This is an awesome app!! I get to help people. Although I will say It took awhile for someone to call but this app is cool
App works well. Good audio and video. What a great opportunity to serve others
"Love the concept, but kind of bummed that I downloaded this app this morning and I haven't gotten one call. How long do you usually have to wait?"
Only register...would love to help but app either isn't loading or working correctly
"I tried to use it but the app crash before asking to get access to the camera. I tried deleting the app and downloading again but didn't work either, same problem."
"Awesome app, nice idea. But it crashes after logging with Facebook, and it doesn't let me open the app after that."
"Title says it all, gives such a great feeling to help out someone in need"
Awesome idea but the video quality can make it hard/impossible to help.
Good jobs guys! Well designed and easy to use app.
But so far i dont receive any notification for helping people and i whant to help people!
"This app has a GREAT concept & it amazes me someone came up with this to help the blind with everyday tasks. But, I've had the app downloaded for two weeks & still haven't gotten a call. what's going on?"
It is a great idea to help others. I totally recommend it.
"Brilliant idea, hope that it'll continue to grow and develop, helping blind people worldwide."
Sadly an app designed for someone with limited sight doesn't work if you have limited sight.  My phone is configured using the accessibility features for the iPhone and the app's design isn't capable of supporting this feature.  Disappointing...
"I am sighted and have had two calls from other sighted people who say the app rang them, I had it ring me as well. Please fix this issue!"
After having the app for a few days I haven't gotten any calls. Confused.
"It's super gratifying to use my sightedness to help someone across the planet. Great concept, and implemented well."
"The testing aspect of the app works fine. However,  when I get an actual call, it automatically disconnect. Please fix it, I wish to help someone."
It's such a helpful app that is doing good for others!
Each time I try to sign up it just crashes!! Please update the for bug fixes
"I absolutely love the idea of this, but I can't even log on without the app crashing instantly. Hoping this gets fixed soon!"
"I've had the app on my phone for several months, but have never had a call.  Either there is an over-stated need for the app, or else it is not publicized well enough in the visually handicapped community!"
Signed up as blind. I'm visually impaired and looking forward to receiving help. Waited over 15 minutes twice and no help or connection. Needs work   Currently worthless
So great to help someone find a bench in Los Angeles today. And to see his beautiful face on the phone!
"I really love this app, because of helping all around the world. This is awesome!"
I've helped a few blind people read some labels! It's a super cool way to volunteer :)
I'm waiting to help someone but I'm just stuck on one screen. Do I wait until someone calls or??
Using 2nd gen iPad. Keep trying! Very interested in using this.
"be my eyes.
Thanks for a great app. It's so helpful when you live alone."
You must volunteer for this. I did and I feel great!
"The app is not good , I have been trying so many times to use but when it opens it closes again ! i tried also to reinstall it . They have to work on that"
With this app we all can help people thanks
"Based on the stats listed on the bar, there should be plenty of opportunities to help, however I've yet to receive a single request? I'm all registered so what gives? 0 stars for that."
"I went to sign up as a sighted person, but the app demands access to my camera. I can't understand why it would need video of what's going on at my end, and it smells of spyware."
"I don't want to give it a bad rate , but it's crashing since i signed up .. Please fix it"
I love this app! It is a great invention! Makes it so easy to help others!!
Going blind. This app helps the blind stay independent! I love this app!
"Installed this app 7 months ago, logged in and shared. A quick poll today of my friends on Facebook who have the app installed showed nobody has had any action.  

Good idea, poorly implemented."
I have had this app for over a month and have not received a single call. Is something not setup right? I'd offer a better review but I have nothing to review.
I feel great helping people. This is an awesome app.
"New update wont let me log on, keeps telling me wrong password (which I know it isnt). & when I clicked to get a new password, it tells me I dont have an internet connection. :-/"
Just what I needed!
What an amazingly useful app!
"I signed up, but since i did that it just keeps crashing /:"
This app is a great idea but I haven't gotten a call yet and I've had it for about a week.
"Had the app for nearly a week and have yet to be asked to help anyone.  If it doesn't offer in a few more days, it gets deleted..."
great idea but it crashed immediately after I made an account.
Two months and I never had a call
A great app that provides a very cool and unique experience.
Faith in humanity restored after I saw my eyes.
Does not even launch on iPhone 7 plus. Never had it installed previously.
Haven't received one call in a little over 5 months. Wondering if people actually use it.
I think that this is a great concept but I haven't got a single call.
I just wish it would work on my iphone 6. Crashes instantly.
Since the update the app crashes as soon as you try to open it.
God it's the greatest app I've ever seen
Very nice people and it's very helpful really love using it
Very useful.
I am waiting for anybody to request help but haven't got a single chance to help for approximately 3 weeks already...
Not sure I'm ok with random people calling me at random times. Seems kind of creepy.
"I excitedly downloaded this app weeks ago.... That's it... Nothing else. No activity, no requests for assistance, nothing... Deleting!"
Crashes 100% of the time when attempting to login via Facebook.
The app crashes when I try to sign in. :(
The app Crash when I open it :( looks like a great idea.
Signed up months ago and haven't had a call yet. Most likely just a huge data mining operation. Avoid.
How is a blind person suppose to take the picture and type?
"I've had this app for months and have had no requests at all,"
Every time I try to sign up as sighted and click via Facebook it crashes!
This is a must for all humans! I simply love it!
"This app is amazing as-is! As a sighted person, I have a few thoughts to really take this app to the next level of helping people with visual impairments (and possibly other disabilities). 

Many people prefer something simplistic like this app. However, I could see a companion app being made with an entire social network. 
-- People could friend each other so they can re-request help from the same people. 
-- When a disabled person gets excellent assistance, the helper could receive a rating of some kind (and high quality ratings could lead to more calls for help). It would also be nice if a blind person could show appreciation by sending free e-gifts or even real gift cards. Most people just aim to be helpful and don't expect anything in return, but when someone does something above and beyond to help me with my physical disability, I feel that it's important to show my gratitude somehow so I won't feel like I'm taking advantage of others time and efforts. You could also make it possible to earn mPoints where helping someone will earn points, and high ratings and being given e-gifts will earn a boatload of mPoints as a reward, which can then be traded for free gift cards or prizes. (I'm certain mPoints would work with you to make this happen!) 
-- Sighted people could turn their availability on or off so they won't be disturbed at a bad time. 
-- Sighted people could use hashtags and write detailed profiles that indicate their special skills (i.e. I'm a higher ed mentor/tutor and teacher who could assist with homework help, I could list my computer and tech proficiencies, I could list the languages I speak, my fashion sense, my experience with children, my age, etc.), and then disabled people could search for people with particular skills (and have the profile read to them to get more information) to get the best possible help. 
-- If immediate help isn't available, there could be a public Twitter-like stream where requests for help can be posted with video and/or photo and written description. Any addressed issues that are helped in this manner would be marked as helped so a disabled person isn't bombarded with answers. Additionally, friends could post requests on each other's wall that will be seen when their friend becomes available again. 

This is just some possibilities that could be made available with a more social network-like app. I still think this simplistic app is best for many people, but others could surely benefit from a second app with the added features of a network. Please work on developing this!

Also, open up community beta testing via TestFlight! I have 19 years experience with testing hardware/software and would love to help ensure that the app remains bug-free and 100% usable by the people who rely on it most!"
App won't open after update
Helps a lot
"It is so hard to find someone to help, that this app should be renamed to ""Be My Blind""."
I really want to help but the app is not functional. I can't even register.
The app doesn't work for me even after reinstalling what can I do?
Please add persian language to this app too
No one ever reaches out for help.   Exposes you to prank calls. Just takes up memory on your phone.
In the update it said it would... :(
The so where is great
It keeps crashing every time i open it.
What a great concept!
Please fix it
It's a great app!
I can't open this app in my iPhone 6
I'm unable to download the app.
Waited weeks to help even once. Nothing.  Afraid they just wasted someone's grant or angel money. Really sad.
I can't open the app after the update
How does a blind person know to get this app? How does a blind person know what to push?
Positive. Thanks for the opportunity.
üëçüëçüëç
My daughter got this app and received a call. A man needed help in the bathroom locating shampoo. He led her down the hall and exposed himself. Delete this app.
DOES NOT work at all on my iPhone 4s. Wanted to help but I can't
"Guys,

There is a problem to login without Facebook as well.

Don't you ever test the app before submitting to Apple?

OMG, this is outrageous.

A brilliant idea that probably just a few people are using, to say the best."
It won't let me help anyone
Amazing absolutely amazing
App doesn't work in iPhone 7 Plus
"Great idea, it's awesome to help. Loved it!!!"
Thanks
It's not letting me register
Bravo to makers
Amazing
Never got a call. This is useless.
"App is super,but need language Croatian(Bosnian,Serbian...)"
"Hi guys, this is the best app ever."
Can't log in
Been a week and nothing?
Haven't received one call in months!!!!!
Can't log in :l
This app is great.
Iam a helper . Why must enable the access to camera!
Love this!

"I‚Äôm a sighted person who has had this app since 2018. I‚Äôve read directions to a man, helped a woman find a cat, read a recipe to help a woman fix her family dinner, helped to select an outfit for a woman, and told a man what‚Äôs on his computer screen so he could fix the voice command function. None of these things took more than a few minutes.after an interaction using the app, I‚Äôm always left with a sense of wonder at the ease of use, straightforward solution provided by the app, and it‚Äôs ability to help us help each other. It gives me hope for humanity in these dark days."
"I think this is a great app in general. I was a little bummed out when I learned that because there are significantly more volunteers than there are blind people on the app, you don‚Äôt get a call very often. I‚Äôve had this for Over a year and I‚Äôve only ever gotten five calls, and only one of which I was able to answer in time. The others I actually missed because the alert sound was so quiet and I couldn‚Äôt hear it. It does have a unique ring that doesn‚Äôt sound like any of your other alert sounds, but it‚Äôs very hard to hear if you‚Äôre not sitting in a totally quiet room. If the calls had been louder, I probably would have been able to answer them in time. Also, if you miss a call, it does not leave you an alert saying that you missed one. You have to see it ring to even know you missed an alert.There is also no history log of how many calls you‚Äôve received or how many people you‚Äôve helped‚Ä¶ Which is fine but it would be nice to be able to go and look back and see how many calls you‚Äôve missed and taken and how many people you‚Äôve helped, etc. 
I was really disappointed when I missed my second call because I really enjoyed answering the very first call I ever got. I certainly don‚Äôt wish that there were more blind people that need help, and it‚Äôs great that so many people want to volunteer to help, but I just wish I had more opportunities to use this app more than once a year. That is a selfish point of view though, because this is otherwise a really great tool. I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys helping other people."
"I have had this app on my phone for over a year, eager to help the blind in anyway that I could, I received one phone call and within 60 seconds as I answered it it was taken by another volunteer.If I do not get a call I will probably delete it just because it‚Äôs taking up space on my phone."
This app is an absolutely outstanding app. I am totally blind and using screen readers. Are used both the android system and the iOS system. This app is a most excellent way to receive help on your devices and also the app has the ability to reach other volunteers who can help me with operating my dishwasher printer and other devices. I am so thrilled with this wonderful app.
A beautiful concept. An amazing example that humanity is not dead. A ingenious way to help in little bits. Get the app. Help people. And your done. 10000/10 would recommend.
"This app is beyond amazing. I love being able to answer calls and helping people. It‚Äôs usually simple things like the name on a DVD, or directions on a package. Other times, it‚Äôs medication questions, and important things. I‚Äôm just thankful this app is here so people can help others in need."
Fabulous
I got a call to help someone out with their mail.After my call I had a huge smile on my face because it felt so good helping out.Definitely would recommend.
I feel so happy I just got my fist call I haloed them find their blood sugar and they where very kind this app makes me so happy I love helping 10000000% will keep using forever I hung up on my bf because she needed help and my bf understood and listened to me very happily saying how nice it is to help someone can‚Äôt wait for my next call üñ§
"I am grateful to have eyes, and happy to help people who need it. My first call, I was pretty nervous, but I ended up helping two men get to where they needed to be, and it made me feel like I did something right for once lol. My therapy is helping others."

"After surgery for  a retinal detachment, I was literally in the dark for 10 days. I found this app to be invaluable. I would not have been able to adjust the temperature of my thermostat, if not for the kind  volunteers I reached out to.After bandages were removed, visual acuity was 20/400. I was now legally blind. The volunteers helped me set temperatures on my oven and microwave and other household details. Again, invaluable. Thank you"
Works pretty flawlessly. Rarely have I ever had a problem with the app.   Great volunteers whom I appreciate very much. They‚Äôre adding more all the time to make your call more quickly and frequently answered.Very reliable. Great to have something like this there when you need it.  Could be a lifesaver. My thanks to the developers.

"I Love the concept of this app. But, with all of the wonderful people that want to help out I‚Äôve never received a call! And it‚Äôs ok, as long as people are getting the proper help that they need it‚Äôs ok with me.im a people‚Äôs person and also a giver, I just want a chance to help someone out."
"I‚Äôve had this app for about 2 years! & because there are over 3 million volunteers, I‚Äôve only gotten about 4 calls. But every call I‚Äôve received has been life changing. I‚Äôve helped someone find offices, throw out bad food, and even pick nail colors! I‚Äôve been able to subscribed to someones YouTube channel, follow them on socials and just got to witness their everyday life! Such a great app!"
"This is literally the EASIEST way to help somebody with low vision. I love that I can help a total stranger who is almost always so incredibly thankful for helping them with tasks that often are fun. I‚Äôve helped people adjust their thermostats, reset a printer, I even helped a guy find one of his doggy poop bags outside. 
This app is legit awesome and I‚Äôm thrilled to play my little part in its growth."
"I just got a call from someone who wanted me to measure their poop- I knew it wasn‚Äôt legit because someone in the background was yelling for the caller to stop. Wasting time and resources for people who actually need this service. Caller ended up disconnecting the call. I will continue to answer calls, because someone may legitimately need me to measure their poop."
"I was watching YouTube one day I got this ad I so far have only gotten one call but it‚Äôs nice to know that there are close to 4 million people that are willing to spare a few minutes to help someone other then themselves. If you like to help, this is the app for you!!"
"After signing up 7 weeks ago, I got my first call today. It made my day. Helped a gentleman identify a DVD he was looking for. Loved being able to help."
Be My Eyes is an easy way to volunteer.You answer the call and assist a person who is visually impaired or completely blind. It is direct and to the point. The person who is being assisted is always friendly. I love this app!
I‚Äôve been thru my own s‚Ç¨!t I get it and want to help.thanks for the app and giving me a chance to devs
"You have to download this app!
I was connected with this woman trying to get into her laptop and couldn‚Äôt see the screen to figure out why she couldn‚Äôt log in. She had previously called 4 other people before me and they all told her they couldn‚Äôt help. 20 long minutes later I helped her get into her email through her phone for this code, helped guide her finger to the touch screen to be able to enter said code (she didn‚Äôt have a mouse), then reset her computer login password. 
When I tell y‚Äôall I legit cried after I hung up, like ugly cried because I was so happy I was able to help this random stranger. Whoever invented this app rocks and deserves an award!!"
Haven‚Äôt had a call since I accidentally missed my first call! But I love giving back.Such a wonderful gift back.
What a great idea. I‚Äôve been unable to answer a few calls but I know they go to another volunteer so nobody is left hanging. The one call I was able to answer went very smoothly and I was able to help the woman locate the descriptive audio track on her DVD so she could enjoy her movie. It‚Äôs such an elegant system to help people with minimal hassle for either party. Really happy I installed it.
"I‚Äôve only use the app twice and have yet to be connected with the customer service assistant. I‚Äôve seen videos on YouTube where y‚Äôall brag and brag and brag about how great the app is, but I have yet to experience it‚Äôs greatness. I‚Äôm better off FaceTime in people that I know versus using this app. So can y‚Äôall fix the problem? Thank you."
"As someone with a vision impairment I have waited all my life for an app like this to come along. I'll be honest before this app came along I held a pesimistic view of people at large because I've experienced trauma and adversity as a child and continuing to this day. So you could imagine how I must have felt to find an app where people are actually quite friendly to you. I don't think I've had an actual bad experience with getting help and if someone couldn't help me they were honest about it. I've a few concerns with this app though. The app runs kind of slowly and it takes a long time to get a volunteer. I'm not sure if it's because of my internet connection or there aren't as many volunteers available. If it's my internet connection well I guess I'll blame it on Comcast, those monopolistic dogs need to go away anyway as they charge way too much for wifi. If it's because there aren't enough volunteers, we should try to market this app so that it works on android so anyone with a smartphone can use it. I'm glad there are more volunteers to blind people. When the ratio of blind people is smaller than the sighted volunteers that means help is more likely to be available, but we should try to make the wait times less. When it comes to specialized help I get help almost instantaniously, but when I try to get help from a volunteer it takes over 3 minutes. Other than that I think the app is fine, let's just try to improve the responsiveness of the app because sometimes my phone lags and freezes. Also it'd be real cool if there was a way to meet potential matches and find love. What better way to look for love than on an app of nice people who actually care enough to help you and understand you as a disabled person. I'd enjoy the idea to find a man to one day be able to say I met my love on an app to help the blind see. These days you can find love in unexpected places."
I am very thankful for all of the volunteers to take their time to assist us blind individuals. I am disappointed in the fact that it takes sometimes a very long time to find a volunteer. I have friends that also are volunteers for the app and they said that the ringtone that they have is not very distinguished and that it is easy to miss a call. Therefore it should not be a beep butt and actual ringtone when searching for a volunteer. Other than this it is a fantastic app and does impact the lives of blind people all over the world.
"I received my first call not long after signing up and helped a blind person. They wanted me to tell them if a piece of bread looked moldy and if an avocado looked ok. I was glad to be able to help them.
8/30/2018 I love this app and being able to help people. I wish that I would be able to write a short description of any glitches though. The only option you get at the end of the call is where there any technical difficulties yes or no."
"I just had my first call & what a joy! I helped a woman with the instructions to cook her veggie burger & I eat the same ones! Then after I read the instructions I helped her locate the bar code as she has an app that will give her info but she had been struggling with finding the bar code. I have MS & Lupus so I often need help from others so it was such a joy to be able to help someone else in a way that is so easy.  You‚Äôve really done this well.  The app works seamlessly.
Thank you for allowing so many people to be of benefit to so many people. 
May all Beings Benefit üôèüíöüïâ"
Great idea
Great global community involvement
So helpful with tasks from the simple to be more involved. Recently used the app to get the style of jeans I wanted to order from Amazon. I plan on using this for an upcoming trip to Japan with navigating the airport both home and abroad. Thanks for such a valuable app that works wonderfully!
Good initiative
"As a sighted person I find this APP easy to use, the individuals I have had contact with      have each had unique requests which were very reasonable and easy to resolve.
One person had been sold the wrong color of an item, in this instance I wish there were more I could do for their past shopping experience...maybe link to Amazon?"
"If you had two versions - exactly the same - but one was ‚Äú99¬¢ donation to help us spread into the developing world‚Äù I‚Äôd have downloaded that one because; that‚Äôs a pretty easy way to help the backend of this app - without much hassle!
Thanks for making it.
I thought this kind of app up years ago but imagined it would be trusted white-collar crime prisoners trying to get early parole by being kind of a remote seeing eye dog for blind people walking outside - or reading to kids who had illiterate parents. 
(Have not used yet - saw the BBC article - can‚Äôt wait to do it as soon as I have a free hour or so :)"
"I just finished my first opportunity to help someone. Paul needed help reading a captcha. Through the app, Paul was able to show me his computer screen so I could jot down the code. I was able to read it back to Paul for him to enter and move on. Could not have been easier to help."
"Just got my first chance to help after signing up a couple of days ago! 

It feels great to know that I‚Äôm helping someone improve the quality of their life just by answering the phone! 

I really hope more visually impaired people discover this app and that the use of it makes life easier and safer for them. 

This is the best app ever created. Every app that I‚Äôve ever used is completely for my own benefit. I think it‚Äôs absolutely genius how the creators of this app found a way to get people to volunteer in a way that is so easy and convenient. 

I can‚Äôt believe Google or Apple, etc. didn‚Äôt come up with this sooner."
I had my first call the other day and the joy I got from it surprised me. Someone was asking help to identify the color of some pants they had. I myself have bad eyesight (-7.00 both eyes). Naturally this hit home for me. Glad to be a volunteer!

"First, let me say that I think it's unfair to rate this app with one star because you haven't received a help call. It's quite obvious there are at minimum 10x more blind people then their are helpers. Be patient & feel honored to even be able to be a part of this.
  I think people abusing this app to make fun of people should be reported & banned. Helpers who truly have big hearts & want to be a part of something big, can't when cruel volunteers are getting calls. 
 This is a great concept & I can't wait to see this app grow & thrive.

I have had a couple calls try and come through but I wasn't available for them. Today however my first call came through and I got to help a young woman by describing earrings to her. It was something small but felt huge to me. I've had this app downloaded for probably a year now. It's takes time."
"Great app for someone who cannot see.there always seems to be a nice volunteer available 24-7 when a pair of eyes are needed to identify or help figure something out. Recently used the app to discover what the robot vacuum LCD screen displayed when I updated the firmware. 1001 uses! Just remember to be patient as the volunteersare sincerely trying to help! My sincere thanks and gratitude for those generous volunteers for their patients, valuable time and help! T. Barr USA"
"It takes forever to connect with someone. I don't know if it's just that I need to wait for someone to answer or if it's my Internet connection. I have three of five bars which should be sufficient
 to at least establish some kind of connection.though it is ideal to have the best Internet connection possible, the application should allow people to connect over a slightly less than ideal connection because, sometimes, that's the best one can get."
