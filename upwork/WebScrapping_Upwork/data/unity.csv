We’re developing a Visual Novel (like Chapters, Choices, Tabou). The game will be published for both iOS and Android.
Because players can choose their own path, the story can be represented as a graph. Core component of the game is .json file which contains one chapter of the book. When user starts a chapter, the game then iterates over the graph, node by node. Different types of nodes have different meanings. Based on node types, different views are presented to the user (or some background work is done). When user makes a choices, he enters certian parts of graph and skips others. Basically, there are multiple ways to go from Start to End node of the graph.
There are two types of hard currency and one type of soft currency. User can buy both hard currencies for real money or he can exchange soft currency for hard currency (but just one type). Hard currency is used to unlock new chapters, choose premium choices or outfits.
Users are rewarded by watching ads, completing daily challenges or achievements. Also there is option for Social Login.
