An ideal candidate might be someone who works full time in IT currently but has extreme flexibility in scheduling which would allow them to help with my clients during the day. 

If you decide to apply, I may choose to reach out to you via Upwork chat. If you don't respond within an hour then I likely will move on. Your quick response through Upwork chat shows me a glimpse of your ability to communicate timely.

You'll do tasks from password resets to firewall config to virtual management to Windows server management to desktop support to Office 365 migrations and support and various other tasks. 

We support many clients across our state and need some help handling the needs. 

Hours will vary each week and are not guaranteed but the right person can start this week and will have daytime availability THROUGHOUT THE DAY, EACH DAY. Dependability, Customer service and communication are top priorities. It's essential to this job. You'll be responsible for seeing an issue through all the way to the end with minimal interaction from me. If you fit this criterion please apply and we'll chat.

Hours can be up to 10 per week and average about 5 per week. You will have to work some evenings, on your schedule, to perform updates, installs, troubleshoot, etc. We will communicate every day of the workweek. You must have availability during the daytime every day. If you work a full-time job and you're just looking for work in the evenings then this isn't the position for you. 

You must have the desire and ability to reach out directly to clients as needed and work through issues with them. Sometimes I'll give you minimal information and you'll need to be resourceful and figure it out. You will have the tools you need like a phone app, remote connection tools, passwords etc. You will be required to keep in communication with me and with the client. 

You will be required to sign a non-compete and a contractor agreement. 

You will need to keep up with your time entries in our RMM tool as you're working on tickets- this means time entries each day. Adding your time entries at the end of each billing cycle isn't acceptable. Documentation is very important. If this is something you struggle with and don't think you can keep up with it then please don't apply.

I have one level one employee who handles most of the desktop support and the on-site support. You will need to be there to assist him with more complex windows, networking and server-related tasks.

I need someone who has very detailed VMware and veeam experience. 

Ideally, you'd be located East coast or Central time zone.

Skills needed:
- Communication skills above all else
- Dependability
- Customer service/ friendliness 
- Windows Server management including AD, DHCP, DNS and others

Technical Author / Trainer for Service Desk Transformation Project,https://www.upwork.com/job/~01f5b6e5e5ee620b90,2021-07-12T08:32:03.984Z,0 USD,"The client is a global provider of inventory services to a globally-present internet company. This involves managing stock of various IT equipment from laptops to headphones and all points in between; and to satisfy users’ online requests for that equipment by ensuring its delivery to desk or to the user’s home. The purpose of the service desk is to receive tickets requesting equipment movements, and to make those requests fully actionable before passing them to a separate Field Services department or outsourced courier company to make the physical transfer. Requests may also include problem-solving, and the collection of equipment no longer required by the user, for recycling or disposal.

Documentation on how to do this exists, but it is fragmented, not always written down and lacks format, structure, formal communication, and change control. Some training is already in place and conducted.

Three key areas of knowledge transfer for the Author/Trainer to make are:
·         To train staff to take over from Subject Matter Experts (SME) who are needed elsewhere
·         To create and appoint supervisors / team leaders
·         To upskill ticket-handlers to be able to carry out the function of making ticket requests actionable
This will require research into skillsets and practices. The results of that research should constitute not only the requisite training materials, but also a standard operating procedures manual for the service desk.

As the service desk matures in this function, we anticipate that it will be asked to take on new functions such as traditional IT Support; so all products of this project should be versatile in terms of knowledge to be documented, and scalable in terms of adding new services and scope.

Because the company is global, the Author/Trainer should expect to work remotely from their own base, but at hours reflecting various timezones. Part of the desk is in the Phillippines, another in India. Subject matter experts are in numerous countries and timezones worldwide. The client itself is headquartered in California. The universal corporate language is English. The trainer/author will be reporting to me, as Service Desk Transformation Project Lead.

As the desk is undergoing transformation, it is not yet known how many people will need to be trained, but it is likely to be several dozen. 10 to 20 SMEs and workgroup heads and operational staff may need to be interviewed. The author/trainer will require routine access to internet video-conferencing. High-speed internet connection is essential. ",United States,65,4,29,4.99,49,2015-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,736966.74 USD

B2B Air Purification Company seeking Inbound Marketing Expert to help with sales funnel,https://www.upwork.com/job/~0193e5ab8664f0065c,2021-07-11T23:11:11.210Z,0 USD,"Hello there!

My name is Mike and I am the founder of Jaspr, and I am looking for someone to help us manage our tech stack. 

About me:
I love creating companies, and connecting with people to solve amazing problems that can make the world a better place.. A little about about me here -  [MikeFeld.com](http://mikefeld.com/) 

I believe that talented freelancers should choose the  companies and products they work on, even more so than a company chooses freelancers . So I believe this is a collaborative process where we both evaluate each other and see if working together is the best way to maximum value for the company, the individual (you) and the world (with the problems that we solve together)

A couple of facts that motivate me about the importance of air quality in our lives.

As humans, we eat 2-3 pounds of food per day, drink 1-2 litres of water and breathe over 13,000 litres of air per day. People think about what they eat, drink and how much they exercise but often neglect the air they breathe. We firmly believe that air is the 3rd pillar of health, and we are on a mission to spread this message and provide people with education and solutions.

About Jaspr:
- We launched May 25 2020
- We launched during the pandemic and have been almost always perpetually sold out, only now have we finally got our supply chain dialled in and we are ready for scale mode.
- We have 900 units sold ($1975 MSRP)
- We sell outright and also on a monthly sales rental model (we are transitioning to focusing on the rental model)
- 95% of our clients are doctors and dentists
- We have had 0 requests for return and lots of repeat purchasers 
- We have a new model coming out in 6 weeks with automated scheduling features and an improved design.
- We have lots of 5* reviews and really happy clients
- We have a recurring revenue model where we ship filters every 6 months.

Our Tech Stack:
- Xero - invoicing and accounting
- Shopify -  for order management and fufillment
- Hubspot - just started - for sales
- Chargebee - just starting - for subscriptions))
- AirTable - for data management
- Zapier -  to connect the dots 



**OKAY! Enough about me and the company lets talk about YOU!**

It is important for me to focus on building the business, making strategic partnerships and deals. 

We have recently begin to implement hubspot and start running Facebook ads. We are getting leads and we have a great understanding of our customers pain points and a war chest of content.

However - we have no experience with nurturing leads and creating inbound sales process. As of now our marketing and sales efforts are completely unaligned and require some serious support.


I am looking for someone who has tons of experience creating inbound sales processes, and a deep understanding how hubspot works.

We have a strong partner helping with with lead generation but we need to make sure we are aligned and handling those leads properly. 



**Pre-Requisite Experience:**

Here is the list of skills we believe are necessary for this career.

- **Willing to Drive Results:** The #1 value of our team is results. Not hard work—RESULTS. If you like to actually get things done, this is the place for you. If you want to just be busy and engage in work theater, this is not the right place.
- **Deep Desire to Improve:** We have a culture that is built on everyone working hard to learn and improve and push themselves.
- **Optimistic & Positive:** We believe that optimism and positivity are super powers. If you have a great attitude and your default state is in a good mood, that is a skill.
- **Organized and Detail-Oriented:** We’re agile and move quick. You must be able to stay organized and keep details straight, or it messes with the rest of the department.
- **Enthusiastic Learner:** We will be solving new and complex problems together in this role. Our marketing strategies are multi-faceted and require lots of crucial planning, mapping and manipulating (in a good way) technology and tools to achieve our goals. That often means we need to teach ourselves new skills by conducting research or connecting with outside experts in order to drive forward our results. The idea of learning new things with a large degree of autonomy and working outside of your comfort zone should absolutely thrill you, rather than terrify you.


If this is you, please apply and let's see how you can help Jaspr turn more leads into sales. ",Canada,350,3,111,4.48,161,2011-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,87836.48 USD

At INFOSTACK we help our customers achieve their goals without breaking the bank. 

As one of the world's fastest-growing online education and publishing companies, we offer cutting-edge programs in health, finance, business, marketing, writing, and self-publishing. 

We do this by curating premium collections of tools, training, and resources and offering them up to 99% off list price for short periods. (We call these hand-curated bundles “Super Stacks”)

With a rapidly expanding user base of over 50,000+ happy customers, hundreds of top-tier partners, and over 1,000+ active affiliates, we’re primed to make a substantial leap forward in the next 12 - 18 months.

And that’s where you come in...

AS OUR PROJECT MANAGER / EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT...

You’ll be the “glue” between the founders who are leading strategy and the rest of the team who are ready to roll their sleeves up and get things done. 

Your job will be to implement and execute our vision. 

We run at 100 miles an hour, create tons of opportunities (we’ve never seen an idea we didn’t like)...and as a result, we sometimes leave things “half baked” or incomplete.

We need someone who is operations focused who can coordinate the different departments and execute the systems and processes we have in place.

You’ll bring your drive, attention to detail, and organizational abilities to:

-Work closely with the founders to help communicate our short and long-term goals and vision throughout the organization as you lead implementation.
-Creatively solve problems.
-Coordinate, organize, and take lead on multiple “Super Stack” projects at once.
-Keep projects moving forward, the team fully communicating, and make sure all deadlines are met. 

ON THE DAY TO DAY YOU WILL...

-Lead the development and launch of new “Super Stack” collections (you’ll work closely with the founders to plan each campaign). 
-Coordinate the recruitment of partners and products for each “Super Stack” (you’ll work closely with our team of researchers, our outreach coordinator, and the founders to ensure we’re filling every “Super Stack” with top-tier content)
-Manage the creation of all assets for each new “Super Stack” launch (you’ll work closely with our writer and graphic designer to produce assets for each of our campaigns)
-Manage deadlines and ensure KPIs are being hit
-Monitor and provide reports on the progress of each new “Super Stack”
-Lead the QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) process for all products in every “Super Stack” 
-Maintain and organize the “Super Stack” launch schedule (ensuring we’re clear on the next steps for all projects, at least 6 months out)
-Create and manage a “To-Do” list for each “Super Stack” assuring that all team members are on task and meeting deadlines.
-Manage and supervise all aspects of every “Super Stack” launch

YOU’RE A GREAT FIT FOR THIS ROLE IF...

-You’re detail-oriented and great at making sure things don’t “slip through the cracks.” 
-You’re comfortable moving fast, working to meet deadlines, and you love leading a remote team to get things done.
-You’re excited about being a key player on the INFOSTACK team and helping take our operations to the next level.
-You’re a culture fit with our team of fun, collaborative, high-energy people from around the world.  

WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR...

The best candidate for the job will have:

-2+ years experience as a Project Coordinator and or Executive Administrative Assistant.
-Outstanding communication skills, both written and verbal.
-Ability to work independently and solve creative problems.
-A proven track record of successfully managing multiple projects simultaneously.
-Experience leading and managing teams.
-The ability to comfortably manage both the administrative side of a business, and the marketing and sales side (your role will touch both areas and you will manage individuals who are working on every aspect of the “Super Stacks” we put together).
-Technical proficiency with WordPress, email marketing systems (e.g. Activecampaign), and database tools / CRMs (e.g. Airtable); Bonus points if you know how to navigate the “Oxygen Builder” WordPress theme/plugin.
-It’s helpful, but not required if you have led teams in a company that grew to between $3 and $10 million annual revenue.

It also requires you not be afraid of “getting your hands dirty” with certain tech platforms.  For example, we use Clickup, Kajabi, Aweber and a few others.  You don’t have to know how to use them, but using those or similar applications is a must.  Also, we use Google Sheets so you need to have experience with  spreadsheets 

You can find out more about us at www.ronreich.com. 

I’m really looking for someone who can grow with the company as we grow.  Ideally, you are also committed to growing as a person as well.

I’m looking forward to seeing your proposal!

Executive assistant needed for CEO in  e-commerce,https://www.upwork.com/job/~01aeafdd784c101033,2021-07-19T04:56:25.224Z,0 USD,"I’m a CEO of an e-commerce business in need of an executive assistant. 

If you have prior  experience as an executive assistant, you don’t need a job description because you already are aware of what the role of an EA consists of: 

EA: Assisting the executive in the wide ranging tasks that the executive will do, the predictable and unpredictable. 

This isn’t a posting for a full time executive assistant. 

It’s a posting  for a remote role specific EA position that serves as a 3 month paid interview process of working with remote EAs to find the EA that works well with me and has the best working chemistry. 

 I don’t know you, and you don’t know me. I don’t believe that you and I should jump head first into our working relationship without knowing if we are the best possible CEO/EA tandem on the planet! Taking on 1 role at a time and mastering that is better than taking on multiple roles at a time and being “ok” at all of them. 

I believe that I shouldn’t  require you to dedicate a long portion of your  life learning and working for an executive only to settle for a working relationship that’s “ok, manageable, or that pays the bills”  just because you “needed a job” and just tried to “make it work” with an executive you agreed to take the job for after going on a couple short interviews. 

There’s no way to really determine if we are the best pairing of an executive/executive assistant in the world in just 1 or two interviews. 

 You won’t  even know if you want to be my executive assistant until you work with me in a few defined roles and see how much you like working with me as well as how much I like working with you. ( my determinating  framework is:  “Do i get more important work done with you than I would with an average EA”) 

This first defined role is to help me execute a number of tech projects that need to be executed in a time sensitive manner and in rapid fire action. 

 If there’s a project that needs to be executed, it has to have a clear start and stop date and be completed underbudget. 

Ok, now for the details of this role: 


The way I’m looking to have this executive assistant work, is by: 

1.  Mentally grasping the project I’m trying to accomplish perfectly. 
2.  explaining it to an expert freelancer here on upwork with the understating of the time constraint. 
3. following up until completion under budget. 

Types of projects: 
Software Tech projects
Advertised tech projects
E-commerce platform tech projects

I’ll set the direction on every  project, but interviewing, hiring, explain, and checking for completion is simply too hard for me to do on my own. A good executive assistant understands what it’s like to do something like this and help me execute my projects in THIS particular manner (where clarity, speed, and completion are king)

Example of Project length time: 

24 hour, 48 hour, 72 hours, or 5 day projects. 

Ex: 72 hours: 

1.understand that the simplicity of this project is indeed a 72 hour project. 

2.Hire someone from upwork that is specialized enough to do the task. 

If they can’t finish it in the same time frame after being explained the project fully, either I set the wrong direction, or the “expert from upwork” is not really an “expert”

If this sounds like something you might be interested in, please apply.",United States,137,6,16,4.77,34,2020-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,29538.91 USD

We are looking for an Angular Developer who will be responsible for the ongoing development of our products. We’re about to migrate our 2 products into the cloud to be multi-tenanted applications; as part of this effort we will change our client-side code from ASP.Net Webforms to JavaScript (Angular) and you will be a guiding light to ensure this goes smoothly. Performance, scalability and security will be key. Naturally, you will employ good coding practices such as incorporating reusable code as part of a shared library, rigorous source control (git), microservices architecture, unit testing and peer reviews.  
About us

Juriba is the leading provider of digital transformation and workspace automation software. We are a forward-thinking, creative ISV with a passion for bringing harmony to the chaotic world of data and business process. You will be part of an ambitious company and a friendly team who are working on a suite of applications unlike anything else on the market. Our clients are large companies (many Fortune 500) with lots of data about their Desktop environment, but very little information. Our products help them make sense of it all and get their migration projects flying. 

Our people are our biggest asset

As a privately owned company, we have an approachable and engaged leadership. We're small enough to operate as a close-knit team, with an open, inclusive, and unpolitical atmosphere yet big enough to offer multiple career paths, a diverse work environment, and the opportunity to make a difference.

We take a lot of pride in our products and have plenty of great ideas to make it even better; we need you to help us make these happen.

Description of the role

You will be working in an agile development environment. Deliverables will be set and you will manage these to agreed milestones and deadlines. You will collaborate with the Product team to understand changing requirements and give progress reports, thereby avoiding any nasty surprises. Other members of the team will be working remotely from you, so an ability to self-manage and self-motivate is essential. Communication will be a key skill to enable you to work effectively with the rest of the development team and understand cross-impacts. You will work within a development lifecycle and be responsible for much of your own building, testing, documentation and bug-fixing. You must be flexible enough to adapt to a rapidly changing development landscape, whilst managing your time effectively to be able to meet deadlines. 

There is no limit to how involved; there’s a lot of moving parts and you’ll always find something new to get involved with. We’re continuously searching for ways to improve, so your opinions and innovations will always be welcome.

●	Building an enterprise web application 
●	Collaborating with product, design, test and development team members 
●	Translating wireframes, storyboards and written specs into a working web app 
●	Developing and maintaining UI component libraries

Internal Project Manager,https://www.upwork.com/job/~011c666aaadb5a37d7,2021-07-21T15:43:49.000Z,0 USD,"🥱 The TL:DR;
We’re looking for an Internal Project Manager. An Internal Project Manager is a mix between a Delivery Manager / Scrum Master and a project manager. Your goal is to orchestrate our team to execute projects on-time, on-budget and with high-quality by removing blockers, providing clarity and actually preparing the work the team will do. You do so, working alongside your team of engineers and a Client Success Manager (i.e. your point of contact and representative of the client). This is a fully-remote, permanent, full-time position.

👉 This is for you if…
1. You’re looking for a remote, long-term position
2. You have experience (2/3 years) managing digital projects *
3. You have some technical understanding (although you don’t need to code) and have managed digital (web/mobile) projects.
4. You are fluent in English
5. You have an entrepreneurial, self-started, get things done mentality — the whole point is to get things done;
6. You’re highly organized and can be productive;
7. Have hands on experience with project management software Brownie points for Clickup experience (as we use it);

* alternatively you’re a developer looking to make a jump into project / product management

💪 This is even better if…
1. You have agency experience;
2. Ability to handle and think quickly under pressure, as well as motivate and engage the team to produce the best possible results.
3. Experience running with Agile methodology (preparing, running, controlling sprints);

👩🏻‍💻 What you’ll do
You’ll be responsible to work across our multiple client projects and coordinate internal teams of developers and designers to deliver client projects following agile principles. Here’s what we hope you’ll do:
— Internally manage the execution of 1-3 projects simultaneously.
— Communicate often and properly with internal team members on responsibilities, tasks, expectations.
— Prepare (based on an initial scope and associated project plan and milestones) sprints and tasks within sprints, ensuring they do have the right level of detail for developers;
— Work together with the Client Success Manager and (optionally) Business Analyst on building a detailed breakdown of the work to be done and the scoping in projects that require so.
— Make sure developers are unlocked and any roadblock is properly communicated and/or resolved.
— Control the execution of projects, namely at the level of estimations being (on average) met.
— Run daily standups and weekly sprint planning sessions with team members;
— Enforce the internal processes.
— Collaborate with internal teams to design, develop and implement digital projects — this includes talking to, getting updates from and clarifying questions from our developers, designers and QA specialists;
— Continuously assessing working methods and processes and making recommendations for improvement;
— Identify idle resources;
— Report internally on KPIs that are clearly defined related to the execution of the project.
— Work in close collaboration with the Client Success Managers;

☯️ Differences to Client Success Manager
Internally our work is split between Client Success Managers and Internal Project Managers.
In a nutshell, Internal Project Managers have cross-project, internal responsibilities, while Client Success Managers have external / project specific responsibilities.
The two do work, however, in close collaboration with each other and are both ultimately responsible for delivering our client’s project.
You can think of your Client Success Manager Manager counter-part as the representative of the client — but doing work. They’ll handle client communication and expectation setting, will gather requirements and push internally any of the client’s communication or information. Together, you’ll build the scope, the project plan (with milestones resulting from your input) and then execute it.
You need to ensure developers are working, have properly prepared tasks and sprints and are communicating effectively. While so the Client Success Manager will own the project plan, ensure everyone is building project documentation.

At INFOSTACK we help our customers achieve their goals without breaking the bank. 

As one of the world's fastest-growing online education and publishing companies, we offer cutting-edge programs in health, finance, business, marketing, writing, and self-publishing. 

We do this by curating premium collections of tools, training, and resources and offering them up to 99% off list price for short periods. (We call these hand-curated bundles “Super Stacks”)

With a rapidly expanding user base of over 50,000+ happy customers, hundreds of top-tier partners, and over 1,000+ active affiliates, we’re primed to make a substantial leap forward in the next 12 - 18 months.

And that’s where you come in...

AS OUR PROJECT MANAGER / EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT...

You’ll be the “glue” between the founders who are leading strategy and the rest of the team who are ready to roll their sleeves up and get things done. 

Your job will be to implement and execute our vision. 

We run at 100 miles an hour, create tons of opportunities (we’ve never seen an idea we didn’t like)...and as a result, we sometimes leave things “half baked” or incomplete.

We need someone who is operations focused who can coordinate the different departments and execute the systems and processes we have in place.

You’ll bring your drive, attention to detail, and organizational abilities to:

-Work closely with the founders to help communicate our short and long-term goals and vision throughout the organization as you lead implementation.
-Creatively solve problems.
-Coordinate, organize, and take lead on multiple “Super Stack” projects at once.
-Keep projects moving forward, the team fully communicating, and make sure all deadlines are met. 

ON THE DAY TO DAY YOU WILL...

-Lead the development and launch of new “Super Stack” collections (you’ll work closely with the founders to plan each campaign). 
-Coordinate the recruitment of partners and products for each “Super Stack” (you’ll work closely with our team of researchers, our outreach coordinator, and the founders to ensure we’re filling every “Super Stack” with top-tier content)
-Manage the creation of all assets for each new “Super Stack” launch (you’ll work closely with our writer and graphic designer to produce assets for each of our campaigns)
-Manage deadlines and ensure KPIs are being hit
-Monitor and provide reports on the progress of each new “Super Stack”
-Lead the QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) process for all products in every “Super Stack” 
-Maintain and organize the “Super Stack” launch schedule (ensuring we’re clear on the next steps for all projects, at least 6 months out)
-Create and manage a “To-Do” list for each “Super Stack” assuring that all team members are on task and meeting deadlines.
-Manage and supervise all aspects of every “Super Stack” launch

YOU’RE A GREAT FIT FOR THIS ROLE IF...

-You’re detail-oriented and great at making sure things don’t “slip through the cracks.” 
-You’re comfortable moving fast, working to meet deadlines, and you love leading a remote team to get things done.
-You’re excited about being a key player on the INFOSTACK team and helping take our operations to the next level.
-You’re a culture fit with our team of fun, collaborative, high-energy people from around the world.  

WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR...

The best candidate for the job will have:

-2+ years experience as a Project Coordinator and or Executive Administrative Assistant.
-Outstanding communication skills, both written and verbal.
-Ability to work independently and solve creative problems.
-A proven track record of successfully managing multiple projects simultaneously.
-Experience leading and managing teams.
-The ability to comfortably manage both the administrative side of a business, and the marketing and sales side (your role will touch both areas and you will manage individuals who are working on every aspect of the “Super Stacks” we put together).
-Technical proficiency with WordPress, email marketing systems (e.g. Activecampaign), and database tools / CRMs (e.g. Airtable); Bonus points if you know how to navigate the “Oxygen Builder” WordPress theme/plugin.
-It’s helpful, but not required if you have led teams in a company that grew to between $3 and $10 million annual revenue.

(This position is entirely virtual/remote (so, yes, you can feel free to work from your favorite tropical beach, Shirley Temple in hand -- as long as you have a strong internet connection you’re good to go 💯🔥😉).

We provide a competitive compensation package, including base salary and performance bonuses, unlimited paid time off, and paid holidays (we encourage our team members to take the time they need to stay fresh and energized).

Our expectation is that you’ll start out at 20 hours a week with the intention to grow into a full-time role within 60 to 90 days.",United States,40,1,32,4.96,29,2014-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,35118.95 USD
