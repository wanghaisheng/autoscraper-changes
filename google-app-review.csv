Right now its over 2 million volunteers and about 100 thousand low sighted/blind people that could call you and it only takes about 1-5 minutes helping them out. Mostly you get asked simple questions like what color a shirt has for example. It always makes me feel happier after helping a person and maybe even making their day a little better.
